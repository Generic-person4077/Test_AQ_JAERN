# Casting Styles
Casting styles are masteries that change and augment the casting process of your spells. Normally only one casting style can be used during the cast of any spell, but some effects and equipment may allow for more. Casting styles may not be used on deferred spells or effects of magic items.

These entries are organised as follows:
###### Name
Base cost, Attribute limit, Backgrounds that can buy this at base cost  
Description paragraph.
###### Battle Cast
1000, CSE/4, #Mage #Priest #Psion  
Cast a spell and make a simple attack. If the spell is “touch” targeted, it is delivered on hit. If it is LOS targeted, it targets the creature or object that the attack hits even if outside the spell’s normal target distance. On a miss the spell fizzles, wasting units, but not experience points. For each rank, add +2 to hit and damage (skill) on the simple attack.
###### Dance Cast
1000, AGI/4, #Mage #Priest   
Instead of using your hands, the movement of your entire body is used for spell casting. You may not use this casting style when rooted, grappled or restrained. For each rank, add +1 to Move DVs until your next round of action.
###### Deferred Cast
2000, CSE/4, #Mage #Priest #Psion   
You learn how to hold spells prepared for a short time. The spell augmented with this casting style does not activate at the end of its normal casting time and instead may be triggered using a fifth on any following round within the next minute. Any cost of the casting is paid at the end of casting time, not the spell activation. For each rank, one spell can be deferred.
###### Maintained Cast
2000, WIL/4, #Mage #Priest    
You learn how to connect the spell to your magic reserves in a manner that allows it to extend its duration. When the spell reaches the end of its duration it will pull units equal to the original unit cost from the pool to extend the duration by the original spell duration (modified by any relevant finesses). If the spell requires a resistance check from the target, the resistance check must be attempted every time the duration is extended. For each rank, you may have one spell maintained. The spell is no longer maintained if you decide to not extend it, the spell is dropped or revoked, or it cannot pull enough units from the pool due to the pool being insufficient or you hitting the limit of units spent per round. Instantaneous spells cannot be maintained.
###### Merciful Cast
1000, CSE/4, #Mage #Priest #Psion    
You can masterfully limit the damage your spell does. If a creature would die from the damage of your spell, it is instead at 0 and unconscious. A number of creatures can be affected equal to the rank.
###### Mindful Cast
1000, PER/4, #Mage #Priest #Psion    
You demonstrate precise control over your spell’s  area of effect. For each rank you may exclude one creature or object from the “radius”, “volume” or “hearing” areas of effect.
###### Reaping Cast
1000, PWR/4, #Mage #Priest #Psion    
You condense the spell’s energy to its limits, making the resulting effect more destructive. For each rank, increase the damage of the spell (if any) by 1d4. This bonus applies to the first instance of damage from the spell before any resistance checks.
###### Silent Cast
3000, unranked, #Mage #Priest    
Your spell casting process does not require the use of words and chants, just the arcane gestures.
###### Verbal Cast
3000, unranked, #Mage #Priest    
Your spell casting process does not require the use of hand movements, just the arcane chants.
