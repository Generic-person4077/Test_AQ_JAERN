# Introduction
"A master of the mind, capable of turning thought into powerful magical effects."

A Psion's attack modifier costs (or MOD costs) are: __400, 600, 500__

The primary attributes for Psions are INT and WIL, but every attribute is important for Psions. As this class is __difficult__ to play, planning or the ability to respec will be important.

There are 6 Psionic disciplines, each discipline relates to a different attribute.  
In each discipline there is some number of Psionic abilities, ranging in rank from __1 to 16__.

# Psionic Disciplines and Buying Abilities
Psions can _have abilities in_ a total of INT/4 (rounded down) disciplines.  
Psions can pick up to three disciplines to be "Primary disciplines" which the Psion can buy abilities in for $300 * rank$ (if the Psion has the INT to have abilities in those disciplines).  
Other disciplines' (that the Psion has the INT required for) abilities cost $600 * rank$

Psions can only buy Psionic abilities as high in rank as the attribute listed for its discipline and can purchase a number of abilities in a single group equal to double the attribute.  
Note that to learn the next rank of ability in a discipline you must buy at least one ability of the previous rank in that discipline.

# Psionic Spellcasting
The spellcasting resource for Psions is known as Psionic Units or PU.

Psionic unit recovery is based on your WIL attribute, you regenerate PU at a rate equal to your WIL attribute in units over a full rest period.
You may not spend more Psionic Units in a single round than your WIL attribute.

Casting a Psionic "spell" is called "Activating" that Psionic ability.
By default, Psionic abilities have verbal and somatic components, and cost their rank in PU, however, by concentrating on activating a Psionic ability for an action and a fifth, the Psion can make one of the following changes to the ability:
- Remove verbal and somatic components.
- Use an extra Casting Style.
- Modify the abilityâ€™s resistance check roll by 2 up to the normal maximum.

Psions can, at any time, spend one action to end as many of the abilities they are maintaining as they wish. This action does not cost any Psionic Units and any number of abilities can be ended with the same action.

Psionic abilities that have resistance checks are unique in that the check is different between activations of the ability. When the Psion activates an ability with a resistance check, they will see that the check is something like $(1d3+1)d6$ vs. WIL negates. This notation means that the Psion rolls 1d3 and adds one, then the target(s) must make a check of that number of d6 against their WIL.

Some Psionic abilities above rank 12 cost EXP.  
Psionic abilities follow their own rules for EXP cost, which are listed with the ability. If the caster does not have the required number of experience points, they lose points of PWR greater than or equal in experience cost to the amount required (if they lose more experience points worth of PWR then were required to cast the spell, these extra experience points can be used for purchasing the lost point of PWR later, but cannot be used for anything else). A Psion cannot use these abilities unless they have the EXP to cast them, they simply fail else wise.
