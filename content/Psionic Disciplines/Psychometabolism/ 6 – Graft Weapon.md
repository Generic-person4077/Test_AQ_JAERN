This ability grafts a weapon into the caster’s hand. During the duration the user cannot drop the weapon and it cannot be disarmed. The user gets a +1 to hit and to damage with this weapon while it is grafted to them. Any weapon can be grafted this way, but if the weapon normally requires two hands the user must still use their second hand to wield it.
