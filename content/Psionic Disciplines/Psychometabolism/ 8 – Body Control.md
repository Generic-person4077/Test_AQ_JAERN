This ability allows the target to adapt their body to be perfectly suited for an environment. The change must be for a specific surrounding such as extreme heat, cold, an elemental plane, water, acid, or any other environmental condition. The target fits into the chosen environment like a native organism. They can breathe and move normally and take no damage from being in the chosen environment. No attack or spell effect in any form can be considered part of an environment.
