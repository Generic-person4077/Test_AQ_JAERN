This ability changes the user's body into another race. This cannot change mass, so their size will remain approximately the same. The user loses all physical creature abilities they have and gains all physical creature abilities of the specified race. This cannot be used to change into a specific person or creature, only their race so the user cannot choose to disguise themselves as another person with this ability.
