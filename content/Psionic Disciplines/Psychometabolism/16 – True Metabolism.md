==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 5000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(6 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== incredible regeneration  
This ability allows the user's body to regenerate virtually any damage. Until the duration expires, the user gains 10 DP every round. This will continue even if the user dies as long as a single cell of their body remains. This ability does not require active maintenance by the user and will continue until the user is restored and ends it or runs out of PU. If death is caused by an instant death effect, it is treated as setting the user’s DP to -HEA. If the user is “body destroyed” by an effect such as disintegration, double the negative amount.
