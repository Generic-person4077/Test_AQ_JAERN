This ability causes the psion’s body to stop functioning. This means that they no longer have a pulse, no longer need to breathe, no longer digest, and no longer produce waste. They also have no blood flow and gain Physical DR 3. This ability does not kill the psion and they may use their body as normal, they just do not require the normal bodily functions to live. If the brain is destroyed, death occurs, as this is the one organ that does not stop working. The caster is considered undead for the duration.
