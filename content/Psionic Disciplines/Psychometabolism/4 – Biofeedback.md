This ability allows the psion to completely control the flow of blood through their body. This allows them to cushion incoming blows and prevent blood loss from injury.. The psion also becomes immune to the Bleeding effect and gains Physical DR 2 for the duration. This damage reduction does stack with other types of physical damage reduction, such as Resist Fire.
