This ability functions exactly as the Mutate spell, however it will only function on the caster. You can choose one ability, which is added to the caster’s creature abilities.  Detailed Mutation mechanics and a table of creature abilities are provided in Appendix C.  The use of this spell should be recorded by the GM similarly to a created magic item.
