==Effect:== cannot be moved  
When the psion uses this ability, they stop moving and make it incredibly difficult to move them. The psion must be on a horizontal surface when activating this ability. The psion's STR attribute is 10 times greater while under the effects of this ability. Since the psion cannot move while using this ability, the increased strength can only be used to resist being pushed by someone or resist a spell that would move them. This will have no effect on the number of dice rolled while maintaining a grapple since the grappled creature can still try to wriggle free without moving the grappler.
