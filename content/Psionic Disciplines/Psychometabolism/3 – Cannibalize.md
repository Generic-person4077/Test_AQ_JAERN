This ability is used in conjunction with any other psionic ability and costs no PU to activate. When used, the psion chooses a number of points of HEA to lose. For each point of HEA lost, the psion immediately gains three PU. This loss is not permanent, but cannot be restored through magical means. The points can only be restored through complete bed rest. One point of HEA is regained at the end of each rest period.
