==Time to Activate:== 1 round
==EXP Cost:== 1000 XP

==Target:== caster
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(10 PU) minutes
==Area:== 20 + 10/F’ radius
==Effect:== share all effects
This ability allows the user to share everything that happens to them during the duration with everyone near them. After initially being cast, this sharing has an unlimited range and functions across planes. Everything that happens to the caster also happens to all the other creatures affected by this ability. Whenever the user loses or gains a DP, they lose or gain the same amount. Any spell or ability that affects the user will automatically also affect the group. All aspects of the spell or ability will be the same for each creature affected, all teleports would go to the same location, dice would only be rolled for the original spell, and other conditions decided when the spell was cast remain the same. Instantaneous spells that affect the group will not go away at the end of this duration, like Fireball, healing spells, or teleportation. However spells with durations that have not expired when this duration ends will stop affecting the other creatures even though they continue to affect the user. Note that for area of effect spells, the other creatures could be affected by it twice if both the user and a target are in the area. Spells that require an additional cost to be paid in the process of or after the casting of the spell, such as instantaneous rateburners and Mutate effects, must be paid by all creatures in the group. If a creature chooses not to pay the cost, that creature is not granted any benefits from the effect.
