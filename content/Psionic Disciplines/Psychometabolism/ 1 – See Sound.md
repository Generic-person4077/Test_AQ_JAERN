For the duration of this ability the psion sees all sound around them as light. This allows them to hear when deafened, but not in silence. The interference from this added light gives the psion Poor Eyesight for the duration of the ability. If the psion can hear normally with their ears they gain Enhanced Hearing for the duration of the ability as they can hear in multiple ways at once.
