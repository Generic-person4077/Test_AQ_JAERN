title: Mutation Ritual
---
Gradually over time, the process of mutation of living or undead creatures moved from being a closely guarded secret of Magesâ€™ Guild into a more of a common, but costly occurrence. Many psions, mages and priests joined their efforts to develop a ritual that would use rare ingredients, potions and reagents instead of straining the mind of the caster to change the targeted creature in the controlled way.  
   
The ritual can be performed by any of the following:  
A Psion with at least one rank 12 Psychometabolism ability  
A Water mage with at least 12 ranks of Changings group  
A Priest of Osiris or Neptune with at least 12 ranks of Animal/Sea Form
