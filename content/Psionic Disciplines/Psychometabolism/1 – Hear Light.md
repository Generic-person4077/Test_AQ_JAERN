For the duration of this ability, the psion hears all light around him as sound. This allows them to see when blinded, but not in darkness. The interference from this added sound gives the psion Poor Hearing for the duration of the ability. If the psion can see normally with their eyes they gain Enhanced Vision for the duration of the ability as they can see in multiple ways at once.
