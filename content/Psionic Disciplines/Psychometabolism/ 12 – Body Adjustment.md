This ability functions similar to the Mutate spell, however it will only function on the caster. The caster may choose 1 + 1/(2F) abilities. The standard rules for Mutate should be followed. The caster cannot regain PU spent on this ability (including those spent to extend the duration) for as long as the ability is active. This ability does not require active maintenance by the psion. When this ability ends, any HEA or EXP spent on this ability are regained.
