This ability lies dormant on the caster until they die. Exactly a minute after their death. they are restored to full natural DP, and any effects that would cause death again are removed. The caster will be left in a magically induced coma while the body naturally recovers for the next hour. This ability can only be active once per person. If this spell is cast post death due to magical effects, it will also fail. This can resurrect the caster so long as a piece of their body remains.
