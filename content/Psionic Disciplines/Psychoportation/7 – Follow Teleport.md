This ability allows the psion to follow another teleport or other form of instantaneous travel that was used in the last minute within the range. The psion will appear next to where the user of the other teleport appeared. This can be anywhere on any plane that the other creature went to and may not be a safe location for the user of this ability. As long as the other creature appeared in a safe location, then the psion will appear in the closest safe location.
