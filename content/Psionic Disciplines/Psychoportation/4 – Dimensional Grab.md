title: 4 – Dimensional Grab
---
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock, same plane  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU rounds  
==Area:== 5” radius  
==Effect:== grab or store an item  
This ability creates a small shimmering blue portal in front of the caster and a second identical portal at the target location. Anything entering one portal comes out the other. Typically this is used to store or retrieve small items. However with a 4d6 Acrobatics skill check, a normal sized human could squeeze through in five rounds. The GM can adjust or deny this for different sized or shaped creatures. When fully finessed the target location may not be on the same plane.
