###### 10 â€“ Temporal Acceleration
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds
==Resist Check:== willing target
==Target:== touch
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(6 PU) rounds
==Area:== single creature
==Effect:== move faster through time
This ability causes the target to move through time twice as fast as normal. This allows the target to take two actions every round for the duration of this ability. They take their first action on their normal initiative round and a second action on the Delayed priority. At the end of the duration the target is Dazed for one round. When this ability is in effect, any other effect active on the target will also be accelerated. Durations of status effects and magical effects pass twice as quickly while under the effect of Temporal Acceleration.
