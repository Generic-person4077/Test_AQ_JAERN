==Effect:== teleport partially  
This ability teleports small pieces of the target away while leaving the majority of its body where it is. These pieces are no bigger than dust, but are so numerous that their sudden absence causes massive damage to the target. The target instantaneously takes 9d6 energy damage, or half that on a successful resist check. If failed, the target is additionally inflicted with 4d6 Bleeding DoT, or 2d6 Bleeding DoT on a success. Only the DoT duration is extended.
