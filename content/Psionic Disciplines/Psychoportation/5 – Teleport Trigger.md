---
==Time to Activate:== 5 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== ready a teleport  
This ability allows the psion to ready another teleportation psionic ability for later activation by setting a specific condition for it to occur. The ability can only be used on the caster and not any other creature, even if the ability normally allows other targets. The condition can be anything that could be used as a conditional trigger for the Defer spell. The psion specifies the ability to be used and the destination target for it, if the ability is targetable. The triggered ability is not actually cast until this ability's condition activates so no units or other costs are spent until this ability activates. If the psion can no longer afford to pay for the other ability when the condition is met, it simply fails.
