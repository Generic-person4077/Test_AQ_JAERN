==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== special*  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== jump forward in time  
This ability allows the psion to move forward in time and then observe until time catches up with them again. The psion teleports forward in time 2 + 1/F rounds. The psion sees everything frozen around them as it will be when the moment they reappear arrives. The psion then has an equal number of rounds to study the frozen scene and move around. They cannot affect anything during these rounds. Any spells or abilities they use simply will not work unless used on themself. The psion will appear and be able to act immediately when the frozen rounds end.  
When this spell is cast the GM should play out the next 2 + 1/F rounds normally but the psion will have disappeared and be able to take no actions. On the round after that, once it is time for the psion's side to ask questions in initiative, the psion should be told what the scene looks like and be given an equal number of rounds to act.
