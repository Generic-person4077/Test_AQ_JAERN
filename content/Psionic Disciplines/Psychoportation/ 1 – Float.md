###### 1 – Float
==Time to Activate:== 1 round
==Resist Check:== willing target
==Target:== LOS 30 + 15/F’
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes
==Area:== single creature or object
==Effect:== float in water
This ability supports the target in water so that it cannot sink or drown if it is a creature. The ability merely keeps the target on the surface of the water or a similar liquid. The target requires other means in order to move along the surface. If the target actively tries to swim beneath the surface the ability immediately ends.
