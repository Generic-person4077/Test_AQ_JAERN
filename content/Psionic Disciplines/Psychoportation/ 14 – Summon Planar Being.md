This ability summons a random creature from a plane of the user’s choice. The user has no choice as to what type of creature is summoned, but he can direct where it will appear. The creature summoned will usually be intelligent, but if the plane has very few intelligent creatures then it may not be. The creature has no idea who summoned it and what happened to it, but will most likely be very confused and very mad.
