==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== short range teleport  
This ability teleports the caster instantly to another location within the range. This ability does not require line of sight, but provides no protection for appearing in a safe location. If the user misjudges the target, they could appear inside another object or high in the air. If they appear completely inside an object, they take 4d10 energy damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. If they are only partially in an object, the damage and effects are up to the GM. If the caster can see their destination, there is no chance of anything going wrong.
