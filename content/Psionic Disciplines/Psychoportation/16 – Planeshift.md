This ability teleports the targets to a plane specified by the psion. If the two planes are adjacent they will end up in the same location as if they had used the Otherport creature ability. If they are not adjacent, they will end up at a location determined by the GM. If the psion has memlocked a location on that plane, they can choose to have the group end up there instead.
