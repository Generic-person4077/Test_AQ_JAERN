title: 15 – Temporal Regress
---
==EXP Cost:== 2500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 1 + 1/F object/creature  
==Effect:== revert to past state  
This ability can be activated at any time, even as the caster dies. It reverts the target's physical form back to what it was the previous round while leaving their memories and mental state unaffected. This will heal damage and prevent death and reverse any other physical changes except for costs used to pay for things (such as magical units spent, EXP costs, and the stressing of attributes or exceptionals).
