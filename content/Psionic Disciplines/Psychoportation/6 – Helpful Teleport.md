==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== switch places  
The target and the caster will switch places (the spell informs the target of the switch before the resistance check occurs). If either of the targets do not fit in their swapped location, they will appear in the nearest location they can fit in.
