###### 5 – Minor Telekinesis
==Time to Activate:== 1 round
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIl negates
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU rounds
==Area:== object ≤ 30 + 15/F lbs.
==Effect:== move with mind
This ability allows the user to move the targeted object with their mind. The target can be moved up to 50' per round in any direction. If the object leaves the range of the ability, it immediately ends. This movement is not enough to directly cause harm to the target or anything else it runs into, but circumstances such as dropping the target into spikes or off a cliff could result in harm.
