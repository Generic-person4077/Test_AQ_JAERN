This ability causes the molecules of the target's body to destabilize and explode, doing 14d6 energy damage to the target or half that if it makes the resistance check. If the target dies from this damage, its body is unable to contain this explosive energy and all creatures within 50' of it take 8d6 energy damage with the same resistance check for half damage.
