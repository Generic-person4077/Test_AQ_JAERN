==Target:== 100 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 3 + 2/(3 PU) rounds

==Effect:== animate object to fight  
This ability allows the psion to cause an object to move and become flexible and seem to be alive. It can only be used on inanimate objects, so it will work on trees or plants but not undead or constructs. The object becomes flexible and can walk around and attack. The object can move up to 50' per round and attack once per round. It attacks with a +10 combat mod for 1d12 points of damage. The damage type (blunt, piercing, or edged) is up to the GM depending on what the object is hitting with. If the psion attempts to have the object use a skill, such as Athletics or Acrobatics, they roll against their own skill with a one-die penalty. The GM can decide what skills the object is capable of attempting. If the object is involved in a grapple, it uses its own STR score for rolling to break. An animated object does not have any defense values, it reacts too slowly to dodge so it will be just as easy to hit as it was when not animated. The GM should determine how hard it is to destroy as if someone was trying to destroy it normally.
