==Time to Activate:== 1 round
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2) vs WIL negates
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(2 PU) rounds
==Area:== object ≤ 150+ 50/F lbs.
==Effect:== command with mind
This ability allows the user to move the targeted object with their mind. The target can be moved up to 150' per round in any direction. If the target leaves the range of the ability, it immediately ends. If the target is hurled into another creature or object, both will take 3d6 damage if the user succeeds in a ranged attack roll against the target using the higher between +15 and their normal ranged modifier. If the target is a weapon, use the weapon's impale damage + 2d6 instead of the previous damage. The damage type (blunt, piercing, or edged) is determined by the object used.
