==Effect:== protect from energy
This ability surrounds the user with a shimmering barrier that absorbs energy attacks. The user gains 2 ranks of Resistance against all damage from energy based attacks. Any type of energy can be absorbed including, but not limited to, fire, cold, electric, light, and others. At any time, the user can throw the absorbed energy at an enemy. This immediately ends this ability, but the target takes a number of dice equal to the number of instances of damage absorbed over the course of this spell in energy damage and can attempt a resistance check of (1d4+2)d6 against HEA for half damage. This damage is capped at 15d6.
