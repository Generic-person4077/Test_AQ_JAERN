This ability hits all creatures in the area of effect with an invisible force. The psion must roll to hit each creature in the area of effect individually using the higher between +12 and their normal ranged modifier. If hit, the creature takes 7d6 blunt damage. This is considered a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing resistances. Critical hits are rolled as normal on the blunt chart, but multipliers are reduced to double damage.
