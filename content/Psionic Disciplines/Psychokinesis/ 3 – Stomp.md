The psion stomps on the ground and a wave of shaking earth extends forward from their foot. The wave is 10' wide and any creature in the path must make the resistance or fall down prone on the ground and take 2d6 earth damage. Any loose objects automatically fall down and may break at the GM's discretion if fragile.
