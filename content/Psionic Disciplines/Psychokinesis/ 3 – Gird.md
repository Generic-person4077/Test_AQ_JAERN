###### 3 â€“ Gird
==Time to Activate:== special
==Resist Check:== none
==Target:== caster
==Duration:== special*
==Area:== one psionic ability
==Effect:== maintain ability
This ability is used in conjunction with another psionic ability and allows the psion to maintain it without concentrating on it. This will allow the target ability to be maintained even if the psion goes to sleep or is knocked unconscious. The maintenance cost of the target ability still must be paid and will automatically be paid from the psion's unit pool as long as they have remaining units and do not choose to end the ability. This power must be used carefully or the psion could be knocked unconscious and accidentally spend all their units on a girded power before they wake up.
