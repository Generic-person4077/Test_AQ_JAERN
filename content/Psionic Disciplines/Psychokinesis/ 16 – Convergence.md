This ability allows up to 6 creatures to combine their power together to make a more powerful entity. The group pools all the units they have into a shared pool of each type. Any of them can draw as many units as they need from this pool. Each person in the group can use any spell, psionic ability, or skill that another group member knows. If any member of the group is targeted with mind affecting magic, each member of the group must attempt the resistance check for it. If any one of them makes it, none of them are affected but if all of them fail then every one of them is affected even if it is normally a single target effect. When this ability ends all remaining units are distributed evenly between the participants up to their normal maximum.
