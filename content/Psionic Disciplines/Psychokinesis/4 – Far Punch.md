This ability punches the target with an invisible force. The psion must roll to hit the target using the higher between +8 and their normal ranged modifier. If hit, the target takes 4d6 blunt damage. This is considered a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing Magic or Silver Shield or similar protections. Critical hits are rolled as normal on the blunt chart, but multipliers are reduced to double damage.
