title: 6 – Inertial Barrier
---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3 + 2)d6 vs STR negates  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 3 + 3/(3 PU) rounds  
==Area:== 10’ radius  
==Effect:== create barrier of air  
This ability creates a bubble of air around the caster that negates the inertia of anything passing through it. Any physical object that crosses the radius of the effect from either direction will immediately stop after losing its inertia. Material creatures passing the barrier must attempt the resist check or be stopped as well. Most missile and linear weapons will fall harmlessly to the ground and creatures will stop out of reach of the barrier’s center, but can continue the next round. Once the barrier is created, it is immobile and does not move with the caster.
