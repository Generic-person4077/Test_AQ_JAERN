###### 9 – Control Body
==Time to Activate:== 1 round
==Resist Check:== special*
==Target:== LOS 100 + 20/F’
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(4 PU) rounds
==Area:== single creature
==Effect:== make puppet
This ability makes the target a puppet of the psion. For the resistance check, the victim rolls a contested check with their STR vs the psion’s WIL. If the target rolls higher, the spell is negated. If there is a tie, the target is stunned for a round and the check is rerolled the next round. If the psion successfully wins this roll, they may control the target however they wish. The psion may attack using the target’s modifiers and skills with a -4 penalty to each. This ability gives no control over the target’s voice and the target can speak however they wish. If the psion directs the target in a suicidal or self-injuring action, the target may immediately retry the resistance check.
