###### 12 – Disintegrate
==Time to Activate:== 1 - 3 rounds*

==Duration:== instantaneous
==Area:== object ≤ 500 lbs.
==Effect:== disintegration
When the psion begins activating this ability, the psion may use between 1 and 3 rounds to complete its activation. Once activated, the target is hit with energy damage based on the number of activation rounds used:  1 round - 10d6 energy damage; 2 rounds - 14d6 energy damage; 3 rounds - 18d6 energy damage.  In addition, if the target fails the resistance check, all non-magical equipment takes the damage and is likely destroyed. If the target would die from this damage, the target’s body is disintegrated and all of the target’s magical items must roll an equivalent resistance check using STR instead of HEA or also be destroyed. Magical items destroyed in this way must roll on the magic item destruction chart and add 15 to the roll as the magical energy in the item is less bound. Any rolls over 100 are treated as 100. If this ability is put into a magic item or otherwise held, the full activation time is still required for maximum damage.
