This ability can be used on any plan or course of action the psion or their group have developed but have not yet taken. The GM tells the psion the approximate percentage chance of success if the party were to follow that course of action completely and not deviate from it. The psion reads this information from the likelihood of different possible futures. The GM should take into account any differences in the situation that the party doesn't know about and assume that neither the party nor the NPCs will perform any extraordinary actions in combat such as critical hits.
