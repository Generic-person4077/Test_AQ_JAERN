###### 16 – Recall Death
==Time to Activate:== 1 round
==EXP Cost:== 2000 EXP
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs WIL*
==Target:== LOS 150 + 25/F’
==Duration:== instantaneous
==Area:== single creature
==Effect:== reveal future death
This ability delves into the future and detects the death of the target. If the target fails the resistance check, they die immediately from the experience that is shown to them. If they make the resistance check, they take 10d6 pain damage. This, of course, does not guarantee the target will die in the method shown to them since they may die right now, but this is the way that it is most likely for them to die in the future should they survive.
