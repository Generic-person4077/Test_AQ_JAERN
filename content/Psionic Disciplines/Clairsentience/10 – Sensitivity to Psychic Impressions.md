This ability allows the user to see past events at their location by reading residues left over by strong emotions and putting together a picture of the events from these emotions. This ability will only reveal events that occurred here and produced very strong emotions such as a battle, a wedding, a funeral, childbirth, priestly ordination, etc. The last 1 + 1/F events to occur here will be shown to the caster beginning with the most recent and moving backwards.
