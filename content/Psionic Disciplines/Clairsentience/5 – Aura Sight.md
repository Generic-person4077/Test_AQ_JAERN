==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== see auras  
This ability lets the user see the auras of any living creatures in their line of sight. These auras change shape and color depending on the creature’s rate, background, and deity followed. The user can study one aura per round and determine one aspect of that aura of the user's choice. If the rate is studied the user can determine the rate of the creature rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. If trying to determine the background or deity, the background or deity worshiped will be revealed as long as the creature is intelligent and follows a specific deity. Invisible or hidden creatures that the user cannot normally see will not be revealed.
