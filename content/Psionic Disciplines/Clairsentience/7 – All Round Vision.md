title: 7 â€“ All Round Vision
---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== see in all directions  
This ability allows the target to see in all directions around them at the same time including up and down. If the target is completely blind this ability will not help it see, but works against partial blindness. The target cannot be surprised by someone sneaking up behind them unless they are hiding behind cover. The target can also search areas much more efficiently since they can see more at once. This ability does not grant any dice off vision checks normally, but the GM may rule that it has extra effects in certain situations.
