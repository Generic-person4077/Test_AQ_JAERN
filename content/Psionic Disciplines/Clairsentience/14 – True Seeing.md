This ability allows the user to see through all illusions, disguises and shape changes. They will see through both magical and mundane disguises and illusions. If they see a shape-changed creature, they will see an image of their true form overlaid on their current form. They will automatically see secret and hidden doors. They can see all invisible, ethereal, or immaterial creatures as well. They will not be able to see through other objects, so creatures concealed by fog or behind a wall will still be hidden from them.
