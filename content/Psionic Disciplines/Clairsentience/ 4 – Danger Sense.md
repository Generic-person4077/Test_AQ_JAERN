==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds
==Resist Check:== none

==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes
==Area:== self
==Effect:== sense danger
This ability lets the user sense a dangerous situation. For the duration, if the GM calls for a surprise roll, the psion will get one free action prior to the surprise roll. In addition, if someone attempts an assassination on the psion while this spell is up, the attempt will fail unless that attempt is made at three dice higher than would normally be required.
