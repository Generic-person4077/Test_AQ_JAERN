This ability lets the target see a split second into the future which allows them to strike more accurately and dodge incoming blows. All attacks by the target get a +1 bonus to hit and as long as they are standing and alert, they get a +1 to a single defense value of their choice. The target can choose a different defense value at any time on their round.
