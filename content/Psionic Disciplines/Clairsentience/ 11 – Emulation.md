###### 11 â€“ Emulation
==Time to Activate:== special*
==Resist Check:== special*
==Target:== special*
==Duration:== special*
==Area:== special*
==Effect:== emulate another ability
This ability allows the user to emulate any other psionic power of rank six or less from any discipline. This is usually used to cast powers the psion does not know, but at a much higher cost. The resistance check, target, duration, and area of effect all use those of the power being emulated. The activation time is equal to the activation time of the power being activated plus one extra round.
