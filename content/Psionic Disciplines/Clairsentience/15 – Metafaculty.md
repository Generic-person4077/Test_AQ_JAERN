==EXP Cost:== The EXP cost of this ability is equal to the target's current rate times 20. If the user does not have this much EXP the spell fails and the caster loses the units but no EXP is lost. This does provide the caster with some information about the target even though the spell failed.  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== lay the target bare  
This ability allows the user to gain exceptional insight into the life of an individual that they specify. The specified individual must be one that they have previously detected with another Clairsentience power or one they have previously affected with any Telepathy power. The user learns the individual’s real name, the name they go by, a mental image of the individual and their current location, the individual's rate, and their background. The mental image is good enough to count as a memlock for the user and will last as long as a normal memlock before fading. No powers, special abilities, or spells can stop this ability from working unless they are of rank 17 or higher (or an equivalent power level such as the target being a god).
