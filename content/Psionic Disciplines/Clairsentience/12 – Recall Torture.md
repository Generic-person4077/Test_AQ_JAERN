title: 12 – Recall Torture
---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(9 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== reveal future agonies  
This ability delves into the future and detects a period of extended agony and suffering that the target has not even been through yet. The target takes 10d6 pain damage per round as the future impinges onto the present and shows what is in store for the target. This is so agonizing that if the target fails the resistance check, they are stunned for the duration of this ability. This does not actually guarantee the target will ever be in this situation, it just finds one that is likely to happen.
