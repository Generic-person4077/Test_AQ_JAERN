This ability lets the user see more detail and a few seconds further into the future than Combat Precognition. It will not allow the user to predict other creature's actions before they happen, but they can react to those actions better. The user gets one die off of all checks (attribute, resistance, and skill) they make while using this ability. They also get +4 to all their defense values and +2 to their attack and damage rolls. Also, any critical hits against the user get a -15% penalty to their roll
