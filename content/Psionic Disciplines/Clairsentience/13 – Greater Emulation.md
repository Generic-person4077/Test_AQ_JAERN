==EXP Cost:== 1000 EXP

==Area:== special*  
==Effect:== emulate another ability  
This ability allows the user to emulate any other psionic power of rank 12 or less from any discipline. This is usually used to cast powers the psion does not know, but at an increased unit cost and additional experience cost. The resistance check, target, duration, and area all use those of the power being emulated. The activation time is equal to the activation time of the power being activated plus one extra round.
