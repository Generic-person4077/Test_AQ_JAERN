This ability fixes the exact direction and distance to the point this power was used in the user's mind for the duration. No matter how far they go from the casting point they will always know exactly what direction it is and how far, even if they teleport or are blindfolded as they travel. As long as this power is in effect, that location is considered memlocked for the user. This will not guarantee that the user knows the exact path back to where they started, like in a maze for example. However at each turn or junction the user can attempt an attribute check of four dice against INT to tell which path is the correct one to take them back toward their starting point. If the user moves to another plane during the duration and there is an open portal between their current plane and the plane they cast this on, they will be able to know the direction and distance to that portal. If no portal exists that directly links both planes, they will only be able to tell they are on a different plane.
