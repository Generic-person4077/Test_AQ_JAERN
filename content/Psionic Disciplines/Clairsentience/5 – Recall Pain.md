title: 5 – Recall Pain
---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== reveal future wounds  
This ability delves into the future and detects wounds that the target has not even received yet. The target takes 4d6 points of pain damage as the future impinges onto the present and shows what is in store for the target. This does not actually guarantee the target will ever be in this situation, it just finds one that is likely to happen.
