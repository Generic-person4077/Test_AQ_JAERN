==EXP Cost:== 500 EXP plus 300 EXP per rank of the targeted ability.
==Resist Check:== none
==Target:== 100’
==Duration:== instantaneous
==Area:== one Metacreativity ability
==Effect:== make ability permanent
This ability changes the duration of another active Metacreativity ability to permanent. Only abilities marked with the “Incarnate” tag can be affected. The target ability must be currently maintained by the user of this ability. That ability will no longer require active maintenance by the psion. Any effects that would attempt to dispel the ability, must dispel this ability instead. If the ability has conditions that would negate it, such as removing Ectoplasmic Armor, those conditions would no longer cause negation.
