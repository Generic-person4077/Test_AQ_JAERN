This ability turns targeted raw materials into finished products instantly. The target can be any type of ore, unfinished wood, clay, wool or any other type of unworked material. The user can make them into any type of finished item they want, but they must make any skill checks that would be required to make an item of that type. For example, with a pile of wood and iron to target the user could make a section of fence with no skill check or could make a spear with the appropriate Smithing check.
