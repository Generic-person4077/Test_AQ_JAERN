==Target:== touch
==Duration:== instantaneous
==Area:== 1” diameter ball
==Effect:== condense time essence
This ability collapses a small amount of time into a thick, gooey substance called quintessence. This substance is translucent, and from some angles resembles a silvery mirror. This material protects anything it contacts from the effects of time. After one minute of exposure, if the creature is still touching the quintessence it begins to take 1 cold damage per round. One casting of Quintessence is sufficient to coat up to 6 cubic inches. If an object is completely coated, the quintessence dries and bonds with its surface becoming safe to touch again. Multiple castings can be combined to protect larger objects, but there is a 15% chance per added casting that the quintessence explodes and jumps everything within 2d6 feet forward in time 1d4 minutes, quintessence then disappears. Water and scrubbing will wash the quintessence off and let it rejoin the normal flow of time.
