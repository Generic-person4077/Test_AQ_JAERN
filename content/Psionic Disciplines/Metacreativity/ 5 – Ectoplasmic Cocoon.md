This ability encases the target in a bubble of ectoplasm slightly larger than the target. The target cannot move nor harm the bubble in any way except by negating it with Negate Psionics or similar powers. The creature cannot be targeted by spells nor affected by area of effect spells while encased in the bubble. The bubble has defense values of 10/10/10 and can be destroyed with enough damage. The bubble has 20 + 10/F DP. A bubble made permanent with the Incarnate ability will regenerate one DP per round and will still be dispelled once brought below zero DP.
