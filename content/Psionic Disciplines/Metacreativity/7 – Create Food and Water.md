This ability creates enough food and water to sustain 2 + 1/F people for one day. The water appears in an appropriate vessel touched by the user and the food appears next to it. The water is pure water and the food is rather bland and tasteless but contains all nutrients a person needs. The food decays and becomes inedible after 24 hours.
