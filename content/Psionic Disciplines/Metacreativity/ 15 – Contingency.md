This ability allows the user to specify a condition that will trigger another ability they know. The ability must be of rank 10 or less and will target the caster when it is triggered. The psion must pay for it normally when triggered using PU. The triggering condition can be anything normally allowable for a conditionally triggered Defer. If the psion does not have enough PU for the ability specified when the condition is triggered then the ability does not go off and the Contingency will remain in effect and wait for the triggering condition to be met again.
