==Time to Activate:== 1 week (8 hours / day)  
==EXP Cost:== 10000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 200 + 50/F’ radius  
==Effect:== create a demiplane  
This ability creates a demiplane under the direction of the user. After the casting is complete the demiplane begins to grow adjacent to where the power was used. It will not be adjacent to other parts of the same plane or any other plane. The new demiplane slowly absorbs material and energy from the multiverse and grows at a rate of two feet radius per day. The environment can be anything the user can imagine but no valuable materials, life, or constructions such as buildings will be created. After one week of growth, a 5' radius portal to the new demiplane will appear at the spot the user cast this ability. By default, this portal is visible and accessible to all, but with two finesses the user can make the portal invisible and only usable to a creature carrying a specified item: the key.
