###### 15 – Arcane Sanctum
==Time to Activate:== 1 day (8 hours)
==EXP Cost:== 6000 EXP
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs PWR*
==Target:== caster
==Duration:== permanent
==Area:== 200’ radius
==Effect:== mass read minds
This ability cannot be made into an item. This ability is cast onto the caster, which gives them some unique mind reading abilities. To someone within the radius, they are able to passively read their mind, which gives them some basic information about any person. It takes 1 round to read a person to learn the following information. The target must make the resist check, and if they fail, they are unaware they are being read. If they succeed, they negate this reading for the round (the caster can reattempt to read the target the next round), and are aware that someone is probing their mind. If failed, the caster will know the target’s preferred name, (possibly not their original or one they are trying to hide), the target’s top 2 highest ranking languages, their intelligence level, their approximate common sense level, their background (but not sub-background), and their approximate rate, rounded to the nearest 10. This spell is not considered valid to be cast with Talent of the Telepath.
