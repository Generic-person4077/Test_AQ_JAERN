title: 8 – Fate Link
---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== two creatures  
==Effect:== share pain  
This ability links the targets so that any pain experienced by one is felt by the other. Whenever one of them takes damage, the link causes the other to take an equal amount of pain damage. If one fails to resist a spell that incapacitates or affects them through pain, the other automatically suffers the same effects. If one of the creatures dies during the duration of this ability, the other must succeed at a resistance check of four dice against HEA or die as well. The effect triggers once a round per creature on the first announced source of damage. If both targets are affected by the same damage source, like an area of effect damage, the effect does not trigger for that source.
