This ability allows the caster to hear the target’s thoughts as they occur. If the target fails the resistance check, the caster gains insight into the target’s reasoning (if any), emotional state, and something that looms large in their mind (such as something they worry over, love, or hate). Questions verbally directed at the target naturally shape the course of their thoughts, so this ability is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. In a combat scenario, this grants +2 to all the caster’s Defense Values against attacks made by the target. If the target moves out of the range of the ability, this ability automatically ends.
