This ability interferes with all psionics in the area of effect including those used by the psion using this ability. All active psionics can still be maintained but no psion can activate new abilities unless they succeed at a resistance check of 6d6 against WIL each round they try to activate an ability. The caster of this power cannot use any new powers at all regardless of whether they can succeed at the resistance check or not.
