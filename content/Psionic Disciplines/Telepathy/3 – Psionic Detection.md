---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 30 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== LOS 120 + 30/F’  
==Effect:== attribute sight  
You continuously detect the WIL or INT (chosen at the moment of casting) attributes of observable characters within a LOS 120 + 30/F’ radius around yourself. This enhanced sense does not aid in the discovery of invisible characters.
