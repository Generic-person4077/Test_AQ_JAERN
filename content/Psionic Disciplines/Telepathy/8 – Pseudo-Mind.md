title: 8 â€“ Pseudo-Mind
---
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 30 + 10/(5 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== false mind  
This ability creates a false mind next to the caster's own mind that is a perfect copy, which detects as a mind, but has absolutely no mental capacity, ability to think, or memories. When the caster is hit by a single target mind-affecting spell or ability, there is a 50% chance that that spell targets the wrong mind and instead hits the false copy, which renders the effect useless. Once the opponent is aware of what is going on, they may make a 5d6 vs INT check to target the correct mind without chance of failure. A single spell failing is not reason to assume this ability is up, it must be a noticeable effect or a spell to detect this.
