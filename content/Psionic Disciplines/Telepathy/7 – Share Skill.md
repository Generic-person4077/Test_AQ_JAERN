This ability lets the target use some of the caster’s skills or specializations for the duration. The target does not actually gain any ranks in the skill or specialization so they cannot buy other abilities that require the skill as a prerequisite. They can only use the number of ranks the caster actually has, not any magical enhancements to the skill or specialization. This ability affects both the caster and target with a Fate Link.
