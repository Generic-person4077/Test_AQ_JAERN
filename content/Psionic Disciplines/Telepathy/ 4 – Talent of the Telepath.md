###### 4 – Talent of the Telepath
==Time to Activate:== special*
==Resist Check:== none
==Target:== caster
==Duration:== instantaneous
==Area:== self
==Effect:== exploit mental weakness
This ability is used by the psion in conjunction with another ability from the Telepathy discipline. If the target of that ability has previously failed a resistance check for a caster’s Telepathy ability in the past 4 + 2/F rounds, the ability used in conjunction with Talent of the Telepath will be 1 die more difficult to resist. The resistance check cannot be increased past its normal maximum for the spell. For example, if the psion used the Daze ability on a creature 5 rounds ago and the creature failed, the psion can use this ability, finessed once, to increase the resistance check on any Telepathy ability by 1 die (up to its maximum). If the target’s mind had been magically altered in some way, except from this ability’s user, during the time frame this ability would normally function within, this ability will not function. The methods for altering the mind generally involve adding or removing memories, but active magical effects that change the way the mind works can also alter the mind enough. Spells and abilities that grant modifiers to mental attributes are not considered mind altering for this purpose.
