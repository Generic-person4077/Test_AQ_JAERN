This ability partitions the caster’s mind into two independently functioning parts, in order to multi-task and process information faster. This ability allows the psion to interchangeably use Actions and Fifths for the purpose of activating psionic abilities. This allows the psion to activate 2 action abilities by using their Action and their Fifth. The two parts share the same unit pools and limits.
