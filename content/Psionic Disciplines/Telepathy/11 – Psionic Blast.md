title: 11 – Psionic Blast
---
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== special*  
==Effect:== psionic screech  
This ability causes the psion's mind to lash out in a shattering psionic screech. This ability can either target a 30’ + 15/F’ radius area, or concentrate on a single target. Damage dealt in an area deals 8d6 mental damage, where if it is condensed to a single target, it deals 11d6 mental damage instead. Creatures that would be killed by this damage instead fall into a coma that takes a number of rounds to wake from equal to their negative DP.
