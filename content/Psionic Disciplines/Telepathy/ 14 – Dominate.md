This ability allows the caster to mentally control the actions of the target. Any action the target could normally perform can be taken, but it will not take a suicidal action if it succeeds at a resistance check of three dice against WIL. This ability does not give the caster any knowledge of what sort of abilities the target possesses, but of course they can command the target to tell them, if they are capable of communication. This ability allows the caster to command the target from any distance, but does not allow the caster to perceive what is happening around the target so all but the most basic commands are difficult over a distance.
