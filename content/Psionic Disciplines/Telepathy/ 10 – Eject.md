This ability automatically negates most abilities and spells that are currently affecting the target's mind and ejects any hostile mind that is currently possessing the body. This will only eject minds that are subsuming the character, such as a Second Lifer spirit or a ghost possessing the person. It will not eject minds that have replaced the original or other forms of body swapping. The target, or the target's original mind if it is being possessed, must succeed at the resistance check or the spell fails. Any spell or ability less than the rank of this ability is automatically negated, for any spell or ability rank 10 or higher roll, treat this spell as a rank 12 Revocation spell.
