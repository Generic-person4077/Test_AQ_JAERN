==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single target  
==Effect:== plant idea  
You implant a thought into the target that the target retains as their own. You take 2 dice off of checks that involve convincing the target to act according to the thought. If the thought is something the target might do under normal circumstances, they will generally act upon it.
