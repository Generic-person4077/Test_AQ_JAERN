==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 120 + 30/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 2/PU minutes  
==Area:== 2 + 1/F targets  
==Effect:== bend reality  
The psion produces an elaborate psionic hallucination in the minds of 2 + 1/F targets, causing the targets to react appropriately. The illusion is perfect; it persists even when targets interact or battle the illusion. Affected targets repeat the save whenever they inflict damage against an ally of theirs, or at the end of every minute. This ability cannot directly cause damage. If the target fails the save, the caster gains knowledge of a few of the target’s deepest fears and gains a dice off of checks that involve playing upon those fears for the next week.
