The psion cannot use this ability on themself. The primary use of this ability is to repair the target’s damaged mind. Any sort of insanity can be removed and any mind-altering magic can also be removed by rolling (1d6+10)d6 Counterspell. An unlimited number of spells may be affected by one use of this ability, but each must be rolled separately.
