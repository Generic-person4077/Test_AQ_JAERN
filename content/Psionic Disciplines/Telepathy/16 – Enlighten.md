This ability allows the user to grant intelligence and speech to a creature that normally cannot talk. This is normally used on creatures with low and/or Inferior INT like animals, but can also be used on humanoids with an INT below six. This ability removes all ranks of Inferior INT that the target has and boosts their INT to six. It also modifies their vocal chords so that they can produce speech and grants them six ranks of one of the languages the caster knows at rank six or higher. It does not remove any ranks of Inferior INT that are results of Mutate effects.
