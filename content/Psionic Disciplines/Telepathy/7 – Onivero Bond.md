This ability allows the user to create a lasting psionic bond for communication between themselves and one target, they may communicate as Missive (with no word count) at all times, across any distance, and across planes. The target of an Onivero Bond is always considered within valid target range for Telepathy spells if the caster and target share a plane. The caster can maintain CSE/4 Onivero Bonds but the target, if they also can use this ability, consumes a slot up to their own maximum to be a valid target (ie. they count themselves as 1 held Bond to determine their maximum.) The target of an Onivero Bond may end the spell at any time, as though they were the caster.
