This ability lies in wait as a response to a mind-altering effect targeting the caster's mind. The caster may choose not to use this when affected with a spell. When activated, this will take 2 dice off the caster’s resistance check against a mind-altering effect. They must choose to use this prior to making the roll and this ability only applies to the first attempt, even if another effect, such as Fate of One, gives the creature a second attempt.
