==Effect:== trap mind  
This ability causes the target's mind to be trapped inside itself. Its mind generates a fabricated world to live in until its body dies or this ability is negated. All of its senses are inside its fantasy only and none of its body's senses can penetrate into this world so its body falls limp and will remain that way as long as this ability is in effect. This ability does not require active maintenance.
