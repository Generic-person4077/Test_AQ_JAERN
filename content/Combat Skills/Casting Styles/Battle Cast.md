Cast a spell and make a simple attack. If the spell is “touch” targeted, it is delivered on hit. If it is LOS targeted, it targets the creature or object that the attack hits even if outside the spell’s normal target distance. On a miss the spell fizzles, wasting units, but not experience points. For each rank, add +2 to hit and damage (skill) on the simple attack.
