title: Deferred Cast

2000, CSE/4, #Mage #Priest #Psion   
You learn how to hold spells prepared for a short time. The spell augmented with this casting style does not activate at the end of its normal casting time and instead may be triggered using a fifth on any following round within the next minute. Any cost of the casting is paid at the end of casting time, not the spell activation. For each rank, one spell can be deferred.
