title: Casting Styles
---
This folder contains individual casting styles.  
  
Casting styles are masteries that change and augment the casting process of your spells. Normally only one casting style can be used during the cast of any spell, but some effects and equipment may allow for more. Casting styles may not be used on deferred spells or effects of magic items.  
  
These entries are organised as follows:
