## Clairsentience
###### 1 – Know Direction  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== know north  
This ability tells the caster exactly which way is north.  
  
###### 1 – Spirit Sense  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== 60 + 15/F’  
==Effect:== sense spirits  
This ability allows the user to sense the presence of spirits such as ghosts, dead souls, and nomad guardian spirits. The user cannot tell the exact location or type of the spirits they sense, but they can tell exactly how many are currently in the area of effect.  
  
###### 2 – Combat Precognition  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 5 + 3/PU rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== see immediate future  
This ability lets the target see a split second into the future which allows them to strike more accurately and dodge incoming blows. All attacks by the target get a +1 bonus to hit and as long as they are standing and alert, they get a +1 to a single defense value of their choice. The target can choose a different defense value at any time on their round.  
  
###### 3 – Clairaudience  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock, same plane  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== 15 + 5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== hear remotely  
This ability lets the caster hear as if their ear is in the targeted location. The target must be any location the psion has a memlock or may be an easily extrapolated location from the psion’s line of sight, such as in that stand of trees or on the other side of that wall.  
  
###### 3 – Know Location  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== know where you are  
This ability lets the user know where they are. It will tell them approximately how far away they are from the nearest local landmark. This landmark may not be one that they know about if they are not familiar with the area.  
  
###### 4 – Danger Sense  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== sense danger  
This ability lets the user sense a dangerous situation. For the duration, if the GM calls for a surprise roll, the psion will get one free action prior to the surprise roll. In addition, if someone attempts an assassination on the psion while this spell is up, the attempt will fail unless that attempt is made at three dice higher than would normally be required.  
  
###### 5 – Aura Sight  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== see auras  
This ability lets the user see the auras of any living creatures in their line of sight. These auras change shape and color depending on the creature’s rate, background, and deity followed. The user can study one aura per round and determine one aspect of that aura of the user's choice. If the rate is studied the user can determine the rate of the creature rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. If trying to determine the background or deity, the background or deity worshiped will be revealed as long as the creature is intelligent and follows a specific deity. Invisible or hidden creatures that the user cannot normally see will not be revealed.  
  
###### 5 – Recall Pain  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== reveal future wounds  
This ability delves into the future and detects wounds that the target has not even received yet. The target takes 4d6 points of pain damage as the future impinges onto the present and shows what is in store for the target. This does not actually guarantee the target will ever be in this situation, it just finds one that is likely to happen.  
  
###### 6 – Appraise  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== predict success  
This ability can be used on any plan or course of action the psion or their group have developed but have not yet taken. The GM tells the psion the approximate percentage chance of success if the party were to follow that course of action completely and not deviate from it. The psion reads this information from the likelihood of different possible futures. The GM should take into account any differences in the situation that the party doesn't know about and assume that neither the party nor the NPCs will perform any extraordinary actions in combat such as critical hits.  
  
###### 6 – Clairvoyance  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock, same plane  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== 15 + 5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== see remotely  
This ability lets the caster see as if their eye is in the targeted location. The target must be any location the psion has a memlock or may be an easily extrapolated location from the psion’s line of sight such as “in that stand of trees” or “on the other side of that wall.”  
  
###### 6 – Scrying Trap  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== harm scryers  
This ability causes any person that attempts to scry the target or scry an area that includes the target to take 5d6 points of mental damage per round of scrying. This will not let the user or target know that someone attempted to scry on them.  
  
###### 7 – All Round Vision  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== see in all directions  
This ability allows the target to see in all directions around them at the same time including up and down. If the target is completely blind this ability will not help it see, but works against partial blindness. The target cannot be surprised by someone sneaking up behind them unless they are hiding behind cover. The target can also search areas much more efficiently since they can see more at once. This ability does not grant any dice off vision checks normally, but the GM may rule that it has extra effects in certain situations.  
  
###### 7 – Radial Navigation  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== create anchor location  
This ability fixes the exact direction and distance to the point this power was used in the user's mind for the duration. No matter how far they go from the casting point they will always know exactly what direction it is and how far, even if they teleport or are blindfolded as they travel. As long as this power is in effect, that location is considered memlocked for the user. This will not guarantee that the user knows the exact path back to where they started, like in a maze for example. However at each turn or junction the user can attempt an attribute check of four dice against INT to tell which path is the correct one to take them back toward their starting point. If the user moves to another plane during the duration and there is an open portal between their current plane and the plane they cast this on, they will be able to know the direction and distance to that portal. If no portal exists that directly links both planes, they will only be able to tell they are on a different plane.  
  
###### 8 – Fate of One  
==Time to Activate:== special*  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== reroll  
This ability can be activated any time the psion is making a roll as a free action, even on someone else's turn. This lets the user reroll one of the rolls that they just made and choose which roll to use. This ability cannot be used multiple times on the same roll. The user of this ability is still subject to the PWR attribute limit on units spent per round.  
  
###### 9 – Planar Hearing  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== 15 + 5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== hear remotely  
This ability functions identically to Clairaudience except that the target location can be on a different plane.  
  
###### 10 – Precognition  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(3 PU) rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== see the near future  
This ability lets the user see more detail and a few seconds further into the future than Combat Precognition. It will not allow the user to predict other creature's actions before they happen, but they can react to those actions better. The user gets one die off of all checks (attribute, resistance, and skill) they make while using this ability. They also get +4 to all their defense values and +2 to their attack and damage rolls. Also, any critical hits against the user get a -15% penalty to their roll  
  
###### 10 – Sensitivity to Psychic Impressions  
==Time to Activate:== 1 minute  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== see past events  
This ability allows the user to see past events at their location by reading residues left over by strong emotions and putting together a picture of the events from these emotions. This ability will only reveal events that occurred here and produced very strong emotions such as a battle, a wedding, a funeral, childbirth, priestly ordination, etc. The last 1 + 1/F events to occur here will be shown to the caster beginning with the most recent and moving backwards.  
  
###### 11 – Emulation  
==Time to Activate:== special*  
==Resist Check:== special*  
==Target:== special*  
==Duration:== special*  
==Area:== special*  
==Effect:== emulate another ability  
This ability allows the user to emulate any other psionic power of rank six or less from any discipline. This is usually used to cast powers the psion does not know, but at a much higher cost. The resistance check, target, duration, and area of effect all use those of the power being emulated. The activation time is equal to the activation time of the power being activated plus one extra round.  
  
###### 12 – Planar Sight  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== 15 + 5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== see remotely  
This ability functions identically to Clairvoyance except that the target location can be on a different plane.  
  
###### 12 – Recall Torture  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(9 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== reveal future agonies  
This ability delves into the future and detects a period of extended agony and suffering that the target has not even been through yet. The target takes 10d6 pain damage per round as the future impinges onto the present and shows what is in store for the target. This is so agonizing that if the target fails the resistance check, they are stunned for the duration of this ability. This does not actually guarantee the target will ever be in this situation, it just finds one that is likely to happen.  
  
###### 13 – Greater Emulation  
==Time to Activate:== special*  
==EXP Cost:== 1000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== special*  
==Target:== special*  
==Duration:== special*  
==Area:== special*  
==Effect:== emulate another ability  
This ability allows the user to emulate any other psionic power of rank 12 or less from any discipline. This is usually used to cast powers the psion does not know, but at an increased unit cost and additional experience cost. The resistance check, target, duration, and area all use those of the power being emulated. The activation time is equal to the activation time of the power being activated plus one extra round.  
  
###### 14 – True Seeing  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 1500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 5 + 5/(3 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== pierce illusions  
This ability allows the user to see through all illusions, disguises and shape changes. They will see through both magical and mundane disguises and illusions. If they see a shape-changed creature, they will see an image of their true form overlaid on their current form. They will automatically see secret and hidden doors. They can see all invisible, ethereal, or immaterial creatures as well. They will not be able to see through other objects, so creatures concealed by fog or behind a wall will still be hidden from them.  
  
###### 15 – Metafaculty  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== The EXP cost of this ability is equal to the target's current rate times 20. If the user does not have this much EXP the spell fails and the caster loses the units but no EXP is lost. This does provide the caster with some information about the target even though the spell failed.  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== lay the target bare  
This ability allows the user to gain exceptional insight into the life of an individual that they specify. The specified individual must be one that they have previously detected with another Clairsentience power or one they have previously affected with any Telepathy power. The user learns the individual’s real name, the name they go by, a mental image of the individual and their current location, the individual's rate, and their background. The mental image is good enough to count as a memlock for the user and will last as long as a normal memlock before fading. No powers, special abilities, or spells can stop this ability from working unless they are of rank 17 or higher (or an equivalent power level such as the target being a god).  
  
###### 16 – Recall Death  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 2000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs WIL*  
==Target:== LOS 150 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== reveal future death  
This ability delves into the future and detects the death of the target. If the target fails the resistance check, they die immediately from the experience that is shown to them. If they make the resistance check, they take 10d6 pain damage. This, of course, does not guarantee the target will die in the method shown to them since they may die right now, but this is the way that it is most likely for them to die in the future should they survive.

==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== create shield  
This ability creates a shield from conjured ectoplasm in the target's off-hand. This shield gives the wielder 3/3/2 to their shield defense values. If this shield is removed it dissipates instantly.  
  
###### 4 – Minor Creation  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 10 + 5/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== 1 + .5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== create item  
This ability creates an item made of non-living vegetable matter out of nothing. The items appear on the ground in front of the psion. This item can be made of wood, rope, or any other material derived from plant life. The user has to make a skill check to create any complex items that would normally require a skill check to make.  
  
###### 5 – Ectoplasmic Cocoon  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs AGI negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== encase in ectoplasm  
This ability encases the target in a bubble of ectoplasm slightly larger than the target. The target cannot move nor harm the bubble in any way except by negating it with Negate Psionics or similar powers. The creature cannot be targeted by spells nor affected by area of effect spells while encased in the bubble. The bubble has defense values of 10/10/10 and can be destroyed with enough damage. The bubble has 20 + 10/F DP. A bubble made permanent with the Incarnate ability will regenerate one DP per round and will still be dispelled once brought below zero DP.  
  
###### 5 – Flaming Shroud  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs AGI negates  
==Target:== LOS 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(3 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== engulf in flames  
This ability drops unstable, spontaneously combustible ectoplasm on the target, sticking to them and igniting, doing 4d6 fire damage per round. The target reattempts the resist check each round this ability is active. This does not ignite other objects.  
  
###### 6 – Create Weapon  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== caster’s hand  
==Effect:== create a weapon  
This ability creates a standard weapon specified by the user in their hand that remains for the duration of the ability. The user must be capable of wielding this weapon or the ability will fail. If a ranged weapon is specified, no ammunition is created with it. The weapon created is a normal version of the intended weapon and will not be made of any special materials.  
  
###### 6 – Fabricate  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 6 + 3/F cubic feet  
==Effect:== convert raw materials  
This ability turns targeted raw materials into finished products instantly. The target can be any type of ore, unfinished wood, clay, wool or any other type of unworked material. The user can make them into any type of finished item they want, but they must make any skill checks that would be required to make an item of that type. For example, with a pile of wood and iron to target the user could make a section of fence with no skill check or could make a spear with the appropriate Smithing check.  
  
###### 7 – Create Food and Water  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single container  
==Effect:== sustain 2 + 1/F people  
This ability creates enough food and water to sustain 2 + 1/F people for one day. The water appears in an appropriate vessel touched by the user and the food appears next to it. The water is pure water and the food is rather bland and tasteless but contains all nutrients a person needs. The food decays and becomes inedible after 24 hours.  
  
###### 8 – Whitefire  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs AGI halves  
==Target:== 120 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(4 PU) rounds  
==Area:== 20 + 10/F’ radius  
==Effect:== rain fire  
This ability engulfs the area of effect in a rain of pure white fire. This does 6d6 fire damage per round and will ignite flammable objects. If upkept, the psion can move the area of effect within the range of the ability once a round.  
  
###### 8 – Quintessence  
==Time to Activate:== 5 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 1” diameter ball  
==Effect:== condense time essence  
This ability collapses a small amount of time into a thick, gooey substance called quintessence. This substance is translucent, and from some angles resembles a silvery mirror. This material protects anything it contacts from the effects of time. After one minute of exposure, if the creature is still touching the quintessence it begins to take 1 cold damage per round. One casting of Quintessence is sufficient to coat up to 6 cubic inches. If an object is completely coated, the quintessence dries and bonds with its surface becoming safe to touch again. Multiple castings can be combined to protect larger objects, but there is a 15% chance per added casting that the quintessence explodes and jumps everything within 2d6 feet forward in time 1d4 minutes, quintessence then disappears. Water and scrubbing will wash the quintessence off and let it rejoin the normal flow of time.  
  
###### 9 – Wall of Ectoplasm  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== 200 + 100/F square feet  
==Effect:== barrier of ectoplasm  
This ability creates a barrier from ectoplasm in any shape the user wishes. This barrier cannot be moved or seen through, but it can be destroyed. The barrier has defense values of 10/10/10 and 100 + 25/F DP. If this barrier is made permanent with Incarnate, the barrier regenerates 4 DP per round but will be dispelled if brought below zero DP.  
  
###### 10 – Ectoplasmic Armor  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== 3d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 60 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== create ectoplasmic armor  
This ability creates armor from conjured ectoplasm in the shape of full platemail on the target. This armor gives the subject 10/10/4 to their armor defense values. If this armor is removed it dissipates instantly. The armor gives a penalty to AGI only.  
  
###### 10 – Major Creation  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 20 + 10/F’  
==Duration:== 60 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== 1 + 1/F’ radius  
==Effect:== create item  
This ability creates an item out of nothing. The item appears on the ground in front of the psion. This item can be made out of any non-magical material. The duration depends on the material used. Some materials also have an EXP cost associated with them. The user has to make a skill check to create any complex items that would normally require a skill check to make.

| Material                  | EXP Cost                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Vegetable Matter          | 0                       |
| Stone/Crystal/Most Metals | 0                       |
| Precious Metals           | 1 EXP per 5 gc of value |
| Gems                      | 1 EXP per 5 gc of value |
| Steel                     | 500 EXP                 |
| Adamantite                | 1000 EXP                |

  
###### 11 – Metaphysical Object  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 60 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== single object  
==Effect:== magical enchantment  
This ability makes a non-magical weapon or armor into a +1 + 1/2F charmed magic weapon/armor for the duration..  
  
###### 12 – Ectoplasmic Copy  
#Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 60 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== one object up to 500 lbs.  
==Effect:== create a copy  
This ability creates an exact copy of the targeted object next to it made from ectoplasm. This copy will look exactly like it and have all the same physical attributes, but no magical attributes will be copied. Creatures can be copied in this manner as well, but the copy will be inert and cannot be made to live through any means and is not considered a corpse.  
  
###### 12 – Mass Cocoon  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs AGI negates  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== 20 + 5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== encase many in ectoplasm  
This ability functions exactly like Ectoplasmic Cocoon except that it will affect all creatures in the radius, creating a separate cocoon for each of them.  
  
###### 13 – Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 500 EXP plus 300 EXP per rank of the targeted ability.  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== 100’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== one Metacreativity ability  
==Effect:== make ability permanent  
This ability changes the duration of another active Metacreativity ability to permanent. Only abilities marked with the “Incarnate” tag can be affected. The target ability must be currently maintained by the user of this ability. That ability will no longer require active maintenance by the psion. Any effects that would attempt to dispel the ability, must dispel this ability instead. If the ability has conditions that would negate it, such as removing Ectoplasmic Armor, those conditions would no longer cause negation.  
  
###### 14 – Greater Fabricate  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 150 + 75/F cubic feet  
==Effect:== convert raw materials  
This ability functions exactly like Fabricate except it can convert a much greater amount of materials at once.  
  
###### 15 – Contingency  
==Time to Activate:== 10 minutes  
==EXP Cost:== 4000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== set a trigger  
This ability allows the user to specify a condition that will trigger another ability they know. The ability must be of rank 10 or less and will target the caster when it is triggered. The psion must pay for it normally when triggered using PU. The triggering condition can be anything normally allowable for a conditionally triggered Defer. If the psion does not have enough PU for the ability specified when the condition is triggered then the ability does not go off and the Contingency will remain in effect and wait for the triggering condition to be met again.  
  
###### 16 – Genesis  
==Time to Activate:== 1 week (8 hours / day)  
==EXP Cost:== 10000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 200 + 50/F’ radius  
==Effect:== create a demiplane  
This ability creates a demiplane under the direction of the user. After the casting is complete the demiplane begins to grow adjacent to where the power was used. It will not be adjacent to other parts of the same plane or any other plane. The new demiplane slowly absorbs material and energy from the multiverse and grows at a rate of two feet radius per day. The environment can be anything the user can imagine but no valuable materials, life, or constructions such as buildings will be created. After one week of growth, a 5' radius portal to the new demiplane will appear at the spot the user cast this ability. By default, this portal is visible and accessible to all, but with two finesses the user can make the portal invisible and only usable to a creature carrying a specified item: the key.  
  
###### 16 – Mind Store  
==Time to Activate:== 1 hour  
==EXP Cost:== 5000 EXP or 1000 EXP to update an existing crystal.  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== 4” crystal  
==Effect:== store a copy mind  
This ability creates a crystal that contains the essence of the user's mind. As long as they are alive the crystal is inert. If they die, their soul is drawn into this crystal immediately even if they are on a different plane than the crystal and their body becomes inert and cannot be brought back to life by any means. If the user has made multiple crystals, only the most recent crystal that still exists will be used. Once the soul is in the crystal, the stored mind activates and the crystal begins to glow. The psion can see and hear normally. The psion can now use any of the abilities he knew when the crystal was created, gains six ranks of Mental Communication, and may continue to spend experience to learn abilities. He can also spend 1 PU to grow ectoplasmic legs on the crystal that last for one hour and grant a land movement rate of 30'. The crystal has a 10 in all physical attributes (STR, HEA, AGI, and COM) and the psion has the same mental attributes as when the crystal was created. The crystal’s defense values are calculated normally, but it has a +16 magical bonus due to its size. The crystal has the same DP as the psion had when it was created. Other spells and abilities can later be used to restore the psion to life, but he will not regain any abilities that he knew before dying that were not stored in the crystal without divine intervention or relearning them through spending more EXP. If the crystal is destroyed and the psion does not have another crystal set up, the psion's soul floats free normally. The psion can also cast this spell again on a crystal he has previously created and it will update the mind stored in it to their current abilities. This ability does not require active maintenance by the psion. Body of the psion can be regrown from the crystal with the use of True Metabolism ability.

==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 50 + 10/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single object  
==Effect:== hurl an object  
This ability picks up one object of one pound or less that is within range and hurls it quickly anywhere else within the range. If hurled into another object or creature, the psion makes a ranged attack using the higher between +3 and their normal ranged modifier. The object deals 1d6 blunt damage on a successful hit.  
  
###### 1 – Animate Shadow  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round

###### 2 – Negate Lesser Psionics  
==Time to Activate:== 3 - 1/2F rounds  
==Resist Check:== special*  
==Target:== 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== one psionic ability*

###### 3 – Gird  
==Time to Activate:== special  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== special*  
==Area:== one psionic ability  
==Effect:== maintain ability  
This ability is used in conjunction with another psionic ability and allows the psion to maintain it without concentrating on it. This will allow the target ability to be maintained even if the psion goes to sleep or is knocked unconscious. The maintenance cost of the target ability still must be paid and will automatically be paid from the psion's unit pool as long as they have remaining units and do not choose to end the ability. This power must be used carefully or the psion could be knocked unconscious and accidentally spend all their units on a girded power before they wake up.  
  
###### 3 – Stomp  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs AGI negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 10 x (40 + 10/F)’ line  
==Effect:== earth shake  
The psion stomps on the ground and a wave of shaking earth extends forward from their foot. The wave is 10' wide and any creature in the path must make the resistance or fall down prone on the ground and take 2d6 earth damage. Any loose objects automatically fall down and may break at the GM's discretion if fragile.  
  
###### 4 – Far Punch  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== punch with force  
This ability punches the target with an invisible force. The psion must roll to hit the target using the higher between +8 and their normal ranged modifier. If hit, the target takes 4d6 blunt damage. This is considered a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing Magic or Silver Shield or similar protections. Critical hits are rolled as normal on the blunt chart, but multipliers are reduced to double damage.  
  
###### 5 – Minor Telekinesis  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIl negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU rounds  
==Area:== object ≤ 30 + 15/F lbs.  
==Effect:== move with mind  
This ability allows the user to move the targeted object with their mind. The target can be moved up to 50' per round in any direction. If the object leaves the range of the ability, it immediately ends. This movement is not enough to directly cause harm to the target or anything else it runs into, but circumstances such as dropping the target into spikes or off a cliff could result in harm.  
  
###### 6 – Inertial Barrier  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3 + 2)d6 vs STR negates  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 3 + 3/(3 PU) rounds  
==Area:== 10’ radius  
==Effect:== create barrier of air  
This ability creates a bubble of air around the caster that negates the inertia of anything passing through it. Any physical object that crosses the radius of the effect from either direction will immediately stop after losing its inertia. Material creatures passing the barrier must attempt the resist check or be stopped as well. Most missile and linear weapons will fall harmlessly to the ground and creatures will stop out of reach of the barrier’s center, but can continue the next round. Once the barrier is created, it is immobile and does not move with the caster.  
  
###### 7 – Negate Moderate Psionics  
==Time to Activate:== 3 - 1/2F rounds  
==Resist Check:== special*  
==Target:== 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== one psionic ability*  
==Effect:== nullify ability  
This ability can negate another targeted psionic ability. Roll (1d3+5+1/F)d6 Counterspell. This ability may be used on divine and elemental effects but receives a  2 die penalty.  
  
###### 7 – Psionic Alteration  
==Time to Activate:== special*  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== psionic alteration  
The psion uses this ability in conjunction with another damaging psionic ability to modify that ability in one of the following ways: Double one aspect of the ability: area, range, duration, or damage. Convert the radial area of a psionic ability into a cone with a width equal to the radius and a height equal to twice the radius. Convert the radial area of a psionic ability into a line with a width of 10’ and a length equal to four times the radius. Exclude up to 1 + 1/F targets  
  
###### 8 – Animate Object  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+3)d6 vs STR negates  
==Target:== 100 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 3 + 2/(3 PU) rounds  
==Area:== object ≤ 500 + 250/F lbs.  
==Effect:== animate object to fight  
This ability allows the psion to cause an object to move and become flexible and seem to be alive. It can only be used on inanimate objects, so it will work on trees or plants but not undead or constructs. The object becomes flexible and can walk around and attack. The object can move up to 50' per round and attack once per round. It attacks with a +10 combat mod for 1d12 points of damage. The damage type (blunt, piercing, or edged) is up to the GM depending on what the object is hitting with. If the psion attempts to have the object use a skill, such as Athletics or Acrobatics, they roll against their own skill with a one-die penalty. The GM can decide what skills the object is capable of attempting. If the object is involved in a grapple, it uses its own STR score for rolling to break. An animated object does not have any defense values, it reacts too slowly to dodge so it will be just as easy to hit as it was when not animated. The GM should determine how hard it is to destroy as if someone was trying to destroy it normally.  
  
###### 8 – Mass Punch  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 10 + 5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== punch all in area  
This ability hits all creatures in the area of effect with an invisible force. The psion must roll to hit each creature in the area of effect individually using the higher between +12 and their normal ranged modifier. If hit, the creature takes 7d6 blunt damage. This is considered a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing resistances. Critical hits are rolled as normal on the blunt chart, but multipliers are reduced to double damage.  
  
###### 9 – Control Body  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== special*  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(4 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== make puppet  
This ability makes the target a puppet of the psion. For the resistance check, the victim rolls a contested check with their STR vs the psion’s WIL. If the target rolls higher, the spell is negated. If there is a tie, the target is stunned for a round and the check is rerolled the next round. If the psion successfully wins this roll, they may control the target however they wish. The psion may attack using the target’s modifiers and skills with a -4 penalty to each. This ability gives no control over the target’s voice and the target can speak however they wish. If the psion directs the target in a suicidal or self-injuring action, the target may immediately retry the resistance check.  
  
###### 10 – Psychic Vampire  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== drain PU  
This ability drains psionic units from the target and the user gains an equal number of psionic units. If the target fails the resistance check, they lose 4d6 PU which are transferred to the user.  
  
###### 10 – Telekinesis  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2) vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== object ≤ 150+ 50/F lbs.  
==Effect:== command with mind  
This ability allows the user to move the targeted object with their mind. The target can be moved up to 150' per round in any direction. If the target leaves the range of the ability, it immediately ends. If the target is hurled into another creature or object, both will take 3d6 damage if the user succeeds in a ranged attack roll against the target using the higher between +15 and their normal ranged modifier. If the target is a weapon, use the weapon's impale damage + 2d6 instead of the previous damage. The damage type (blunt, piercing, or edged) is determined by the object used.  
  
###### 11 – Energy Conversion  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(3 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== protect from energy  
This ability surrounds the user with a shimmering barrier that absorbs energy attacks. The user gains 2 ranks of Resistance against all damage from energy based attacks. Any type of energy can be absorbed including, but not limited to, fire, cold, electric, light, and others. At any time, the user can throw the absorbed energy at an enemy. This immediately ends this ability, but the target takes a number of dice equal to the number of instances of damage absorbed over the course of this spell in energy damage and can attempt a resistance check of (1d4+2)d6 against HEA for half damage. This damage is capped at 15d6.  
  
###### 12 – Negate Greater Psionics  
==Time to Activate:== 3 - 1/2F rounds  
==Resist Check:== special  
==Target:== 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== one psionic ability*  
==Effect:== nullify ability  
This ability can negate another targeted psionic ability. Roll (1d3+10+1/F)d6 Counterspell. This ability may be used on divine and elemental effects but receives a  2 die penalty.  
  
###### 12 – Disintegrate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 - 3 rounds*  
==Resist Check:== (1d6+1) vs HEA negates  
==Target:== LOS 120 + 30/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== object ≤ 500 lbs.  
==Effect:== disintegration  
When the psion begins activating this ability, the psion may use between 1 and 3 rounds to complete its activation. Once activated, the target is hit with energy damage based on the number of activation rounds used:  
1 round - 10d6 energy damage; 2 rounds - 14d6 energy damage; 3 rounds - 18d6 energy damage.  
In addition, if the target fails the resistance check, all non-magical equipment takes the damage and is likely destroyed. If the target would die from this damage, the target’s body is disintegrated and all of the target’s magical items must roll an equivalent resistance check using STR instead of HEA or also be destroyed. Magical items destroyed in this way must roll on the magic item destruction chart and add 15 to the roll as the magical energy in the item is less bound. Any rolls over 100 are treated as 100. If this ability is put into a magic item or otherwise held, the full activation time is still required for maximum damage.

==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== blow up  
This ability causes the molecules of the target's body to destabilize and explode, doing 14d6 energy damage to the target or half that if it makes the resistance check. If the target dies from this damage, its body is unable to contain this explosive energy and all creatures within 50' of it take 8d6 energy damage with the same resistance check for half damage.  
  
###### 16 – Convergence  
==Time to Activate:== 6 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 3000 EXP

Any of them can draw as many units as they need from this pool. Each person in the group can use any spell, psionic ability, or skill that another group member knows. If any member of the group is targeted with mind affecting magic, each member of the group must attempt the resistance check for it. If any one of them makes it, none of them are affected but if all of them fail then every one of them is affected even if it is normally a single target effect. When this ability ends all remaining units are distributed evenly between the participants up to their normal maximum.

==Target:== LOS 40 + 10/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(5 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== heal body  
This ability can heal wounds and cure non-magical diseases in the target. Each round  cures one disease or heals 4d6 DP at the caster’s discretion. Once every round the effect can be moved to another valid target within range as a free action.  
  
###### 7 – Double Pain  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d6+1) vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single living creature  
==Effect:== lower pain threshold  
This ability lowers the target's pain threshold so that the tiniest cut will feel like a serious injury. For every damage the target takes, it also takes one point of pain damage.  
  
###### 7 – Reconstruct  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 6 + 6/(5 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single living creature  
==Effect:== heal self  
You put a willing target into a trance. For the duration of the spell, they are unable to move, and heal 1d6 DP per round.  
  
###### 8 – Body Control  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(4 PU) hours  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== adapt to environment  
This ability allows the target to adapt their body to be perfectly suited for an environment. The change must be for a specific surrounding such as extreme heat, cold, an elemental plane, water, acid, or any other environmental condition. The target fits into the chosen environment like a native organism. They can breathe and move normally and take no damage from being in the chosen environment. No attack or spell effect in any form can be considered part of an environment.  
  
###### 8 – Touch of the Vampire  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 5 + 5/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== draining touch  
This ability shroud's the user's hands with black energy. Whenever the caster deals damage with their natural attacks, they gain half the core damage dealt as damage points up to their DP maximum.  
  
###### 8 – Purge  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== 4d6 vs HEA accepts*  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single living creature  
==Effect:== purge body  
This ability allows the psion to purge foreign objects out of the target, such as parasites, bad implants, etc. Nonphysical things such as souls and mutates are unaffected. For every finesse, the psion may exclude a single item. The target must be willing and succeed at the resistance check for this ability to function.  
  
###### 8 – Body Incarnate  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(4 PU) hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== redirect spell  
This ability waits until activated, but when it does, it redirects a spell that is targeting a non physical attribute (PER, INT, CSE, WIL, PWR), to the caster's natural HEA attribute. After it redirects, this spell ends.  
  
###### 9 – Immobility  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== cannot be moved  
When the psion uses this ability, they stop moving and make it incredibly difficult to move them. The psion must be on a horizontal surface when activating this ability. The psion's STR attribute is 10 times greater while under the effects of this ability. Since the psion cannot move while using this ability, the increased strength can only be used to resist being pushed by someone or resist a spell that would move them. This will have no effect on the number of dice rolled while maintaining a grapple since the grappled creature can still try to wriggle free without moving the grappler.  
  
###### 9 – Shock  
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 10 + 5/(4 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== halt body  
This ability causes the psion’s body to stop functioning. This means that they no longer have a pulse, no longer need to breathe, no longer digest, and no longer produce waste. They also have no blood flow and gain Physical DR 3. This ability does not kill the psion and they may use their body as normal, they just do not require the normal bodily functions to live. If the brain is destroyed, death occurs, as this is the one organ that does not stop working. The caster is considered undead for the duration.  
  
###### 10 – Superior Vigor  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing targets  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== 2 + 1/2F creatures  
==Effect:== increase health  
This ability increases the targets' current and max damage points by 15 + 5/F for the duration of this ability. When this ends, any damage points over their normal max are lost.  
  
###### 11 – Metamorphosis  
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== shape change  
This ability changes the user's body into another race. This cannot change mass, so their size will remain approximately the same. The user loses all physical creature abilities they have and gains all physical creature abilities of the specified race. This cannot be used to change into a specific person or creature, only their race so the user cannot choose to disguise themselves as another person with this ability.  
  
###### 12 – Body Adjustment  
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU days  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== mutate self  
This ability functions similar to the Mutate spell, however it will only function on the caster. The caster may choose 1 + 1/(2F) abilities. The standard rules for Mutate should be followed. The caster cannot regain PU spent on this ability (including those spent to extend the duration) for as long as the ability is active. This ability does not require active maintenance by the psion. When this ability ends, any HEA or EXP spent on this ability are regained.  
  
###### 12 – Alpha Attack  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== strike harder  
This ability allows the target to focus all of their strength into their unarmed attacks. For the duration of this ability, the target’s core damage for unarmed attacks is equal to a die with a number of sides equal to their natural STR attribute. In addition, +1 damage is added for each Exceptional STR. These attacks are considered magical for the purpose of bypassing protections and resistances.  
  
###### 12 – Hyper Regeneration  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(6 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single living creature  
==Effect:== regen faster  
For the duration, the target will regenerate 4 DP a round, and mend/regrow a single lost organ or limb each round. This ability, unlike True Metabolism, fails upon death.  
  
###### 13 – Complete Healing  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 1000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== touch  
==Effect:== repair body  
This ability completely heals the user's body to full health. Their DP is restored to full, they regrow any lost limbs, and any diseases or other physical ailments are cured. This will also restore any lost physical attribute points except for those used to pay a cost (such as for stressing, Cannibalize, or Mutate).  
  
###### 14 – Unstoppable Vigor  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 1000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== willing targets  
==Target:== multitouch  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== touched living creatures  
==Effect:== massively increase health  
This ability doubles the targets' current and max damage points for the duration of this ability. When this ends, any damage points over their normal max are lost.  
  
###### 15 – Genetic Adjustment  
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 3500 XP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== mutate self  
This ability functions exactly as the Mutate spell, however it will only function on the caster. You can choose one ability, which is added to the caster’s creature abilities.  
Detailed Mutation mechanics and a table of creature abilities are provided in Appendix C.  
The use of this spell should be recorded by the GM similarly to a created magic item.  
  
###### 16 – Affinity Field  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 1000 XP  
==Resist Check:== willing targets  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(10 PU) minutes  
==Area:== 20 + 10/F’ radius  
==Effect:== share all effects  
This ability allows the user to share everything that happens to them during the duration with everyone near them. After initially being cast, this sharing has an unlimited range and functions across planes. Everything that happens to the caster also happens to all the other creatures affected by this ability. Whenever the user loses or gains a DP, they lose or gain the same amount. Any spell or ability that affects the user will automatically also affect the group. All aspects of the spell or ability will be the same for each creature affected, all teleports would go to the same location, dice would only be rolled for the original spell, and other conditions decided when the spell was cast remain the same. Instantaneous spells that affect the group will not go away at the end of this duration, like Fireball, healing spells, or teleportation. However spells with durations that have not expired when this duration ends will stop affecting the other creatures even though they continue to affect the user. Note that for area of effect spells, the other creatures could be affected by it twice if both the user and a target are in the area. Spells that require an additional cost to be paid in the process of or after the casting of the spell, such as instantaneous rateburners and Mutate effects, must be paid by all creatures in the group. If a creature chooses not to pay the cost, that creature is not granted any benefits from the effect.  
  
###### 16 – True Metabolism  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 5000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(6 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== incredible regeneration  
This ability allows the user's body to regenerate virtually any damage. Until the duration expires, the user gains 10 DP every round. This will continue even if the user dies as long as a single cell of their body remains. This ability does not require active maintenance by the user and will continue until the user is restored and ends it or runs out of PU. If death is caused by an instant death effect, it is treated as setting the user’s DP to -HEA. If the user is “body destroyed” by an effect such as disintegration, double the negative amount.  
  
###### 16 – Forever More  
==Time to Activate:== 1 day  
==EXP Cost:== 5000 EXP.  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== resurrect  
This ability lies dormant on the caster until they die. Exactly a minute after their death. they are restored to full natural DP, and any effects that would cause death again are removed. The caster will be left in a magically induced coma while the body naturally recovers for the next hour. This ability can only be active once per person. If this spell is cast post death due to magical effects, it will also fail. This can resurrect the caster so long as a piece of their body remains.

###### Mutation Ritual
Gradually over time, the process of mutation of living or undead creatures moved from being a closely guarded secret of Mages’ Guild into a more of a common, but costly occurrence. Many psions, mages and priests joined their efforts to develop a ritual that would use rare ingredients, potions and reagents instead of straining the mind of the caster to change the targeted creature in the controlled way.

The ritual can be performed by any of the following:  
A Psion with at least one rank 12 Psychometabolism ability  
A Water mage with at least 12 ranks of Changings group  
A Priest of Osiris or Neptune with at least 12 ranks of Animal/Sea Form  
  
Total cost of ingredients is 1500 gold following normal Mutation rules.
## Psychoportation
###### 1 – Float  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== LOS 30 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature or object  
==Effect:== float in water  
This ability supports the target in water so that it cannot sink or drown if it is a creature. The ability merely keeps the target on the surface of the water or a similar liquid. The target requires other means in order to move along the surface. If the target actively tries to swim beneath the surface the ability immediately ends.  
  
###### 1 – Know Plane  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== know plane  
This ability will give the caster a name for the plane and will tell them whether they’ve been here before. This is mostly useful in not accidentally being trapped by planar laws twice.  
  
###### 2 – Feather Fall  
==Time to Activate:== reaction  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 5 + 5/PU rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== fall slowly  
This ability causes the user to fall more slowly than normal. They will fall only 50' per round and take no damage from falling. If this ability ends before they finish falling, they will take normal falling damage for the remaining distance.  
  
###### 2 – Fleet Foot  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== increase movement  
This ability increases the target's land movement rate by 10 + 10/F’.  
  
###### 3 – Trace Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== 200’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single teleport spot  
==Effect:== learn destination  
This ability allows the caster to know the destination of one teleport or other form of instantaneous magical travel that was used within the last minute. For the next hour, that destination is considered a memlock for the caster.  
  
###### 4 – Dimensional Grab  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock, same plane  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU rounds  
==Area:== 5” radius  
==Effect:== grab or store an item  
This ability creates a small shimmering blue portal in front of the caster and a second identical portal at the target location. Anything entering one portal comes out the other. Typically this is used to store or retrieve small items. However with a 4d6 Acrobatics skill check, a normal sized human could squeeze through in five rounds. The GM can adjust or deny this for different sized or shaped creatures. When fully finessed the target location may not be on the same plane.  
  
###### 4 – Short Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== short range teleport  
This ability teleports the caster instantly to another location within the range. This ability does not require line of sight, but provides no protection for appearing in a safe location. If the user misjudges the target, they could appear inside another object or high in the air. If they appear completely inside an object, they take 4d10 energy damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. If they are only partially in an object, the damage and effects are up to the GM. If the caster can see their destination, there is no chance of anything going wrong.  
  
###### 5 – Go Away!  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== teleport 200 + 50/F’  
This ability teleports the target to a safe location in a random direction 200 + 50/F’ away from the psion.  
  
###### 5 – Teleport Trigger  
==Time to Activate:== 5 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== ready a teleport  
This ability allows the psion to ready another teleportation psionic ability for later activation by setting a specific condition for it to occur. The ability can only be used on the caster and not any other creature, even if the ability normally allows other targets. The condition can be anything that could be used as a conditional trigger for the Defer spell. The psion specifies the ability to be used and the destination target for it, if the ability is targetable. The triggered ability is not actually cast until this ability's condition activates so no units or other costs are spent until this ability activates. If the psion can no longer afford to pay for the other ability when the condition is met, it simply fails.  
  
###### 5 – Stay Right There  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== prevent teleports  
This ability makes the target Dimensionally Anchored for the duration.  
  
###### 6 – Time Hop  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== move forward in time  
This ability teleports the target forward in time. They disappear and then reappear 3d6 rounds later in the same spot. If the space is occupied they will appear in the nearest unoccupied space.  
  
###### 6 – Helpful Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== switch places  
The target and the caster will switch places (the spell informs the target of the switch before the resistance check occurs). If either of the targets do not fit in their swapped location, they will appear in the nearest location they can fit in.  
  
###### 7 – Follow Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== 200’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single teleport spot  
==Effect:== follow another teleporter  
This ability allows the psion to follow another teleport or other form of instantaneous travel that was used in the last minute within the range. The psion will appear next to where the user of the other teleport appeared. This can be anywhere on any plane that the other creature went to and may not be a safe location for the user of this ability. As long as the other creature appeared in a safe location, then the psion will appear in the closest safe location.  
  
###### 7 – Sending  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock  
==Duration:== 5 + 5/PU rounds  
==Area:== 1 + .5/F’ radius  
==Effect:== speak remotely  
This ability allows the psion to create a transparent portal to a memlocked location. Only light and sound can go through this portal, anything else passes through it without effect. The caster can see and talk to anyone that is near the other portal.  
  
###### 8 – Dimensional Door  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/PU rounds  
==Area:== 4 + 1/F’ radius  
==Effect:== create doorway  
This ability creates a shimmering blue portal in front of the caster and a second identical looking portal at the target location. Anyone who steps in either portal comes out the other portal. The user may step through on the same round the ability is used if they wish, but cannot take any actions after stepping through that round.  
  
###### 9 – Baleful Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs HEA halves  
==Target:== LOS 40 + 10/F’  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(3 PU) rounds*  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== teleport partially  
This ability teleports small pieces of the target away while leaving the majority of its body where it is. These pieces are no bigger than dust, but are so numerous that their sudden absence causes massive damage to the target. The target instantaneously takes 9d6 energy damage, or half that on a successful resist check. If failed, the target is additionally inflicted with 4d6 Bleeding DoT, or 2d6 Bleeding DoT on a success. Only the DoT duration is extended.  
  
###### 9 – Temporal Deceleration  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(6 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== slow target  
This ability slows the target to moving through time half as quickly. This prevents them from having an action every other round. The first round missed is the next possible action the target would have after this spell is cast.  
  
###### 10 – Temporal Acceleration  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(6 PU) rounds  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== move faster through time  
This ability causes the target to move through time twice as fast as normal. This allows the target to take two actions every round for the duration of this ability. They take their first action on their normal initiative round and a second action on the Delayed priority. At the end of the duration the target is Dazed for one round. When this ability is in effect, any other effect active on the target will also be accelerated. Durations of status effects and magical effects pass twice as quickly while under the effect of Temporal Acceleration.  
  
###### 11 – Dismissal  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== send to home plane  
This ability will fail if cast on a creature that is on its native plane. A creature targeted by this spell that is not on its home plane will be teleported back to its home plane if it fails the resistance check. It will appear in a random safe location on its home plane.  
  
###### 12 – Random Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+3)d6 vs PWR negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== teleport away  
This ability teleports the target to a random safe location on the same plane. A safe location will be standing on a solid surface that can support the target's weight. The GM can determine the location however they wish as long as its environment is safe to the target.  
  
###### 12 – Time Shift  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== special*  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== jump forward in time  
This ability allows the psion to move forward in time and then observe until time catches up with them again. The psion teleports forward in time 2 + 1/F rounds. The psion sees everything frozen around them as it will be when the moment they reappear arrives. The psion then has an equal number of rounds to study the frozen scene and move around. They cannot affect anything during these rounds. Any spells or abilities they use simply will not work unless used on themself. The psion will appear and be able to act immediately when the frozen rounds end. When this spell is cast the GM should play out the next 2 + 1/F rounds normally but the psion will have disappeared and be able to take no actions. On the round after that, once it is time for the psion's side to ask questions in initiative, the psion should be told what the scene looks like and be given an equal number of rounds to act.  
  
###### 12 – Disrupt Teleport  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 3 + 1/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== 400’ radius  
==Effect:== buys time  
This ability prevents other teleporters from following for a period of time. This is extremely useful when trying to regroup and heal. Anybody trying to teleport into the area has their teleportation delayed by 4 rounds. The caster is aware of incoming teleports when this ability is activated.  
  
###### 13 – Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature or object  
==Effect:== teleport  
This ability teleports the target to a memlocked location on the same plane.  
  
###### 14 – Summon Planar Being  
==Time to Activate:== 1 minute  
==EXP Cost:== 1000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+4)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== summon random creature  
This ability summons a random creature from a plane of the user’s choice. The user has no choice as to what type of creature is summoned, but he can direct where it will appear. The creature summoned will usually be intelligent, but if the plane has very few intelligent creatures then it may not be. The creature has no idea who summoned it and what happened to it, but will most likely be very confused and very mad.  
  
###### 14 – Teleportation Circle  
==Time to Activate:== 10 minutes  
==EXP Cost:== 3000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock, same plane  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== 5 + 1/F’ radius  
==Effect:== teleportation gateway  
This ability creates a circle on the ground in front of the caster and another at the target location. Anyone stepping into one of the circles is instantly teleported into the other. This ability does not require active maintenance.  
  
###### 15 – Group Teleport  
==Time to Activate:== 3 round  
==EXP Cost:== 1500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== willing targets  
==Target:== multitouch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== touched creatures  
==Effect:== teleport  
This ability teleports the targets to a memlocked location on the same plane.  
  
###### 15 – Temporal Regress  
==EXP Cost:== 2500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== 1 + 1/F object/creature  
==Effect:== revert to past state  
This ability can be activated at any time, even as the caster dies. It reverts the target's physical form back to what it was the previous round while leaving their memories and mental state unaffected. This will heal damage and prevent death and reverse any other physical changes except for costs used to pay for things (such as magical units spent, EXP costs, and the stressing of attributes or exceptionals).  
  
###### 16 – Planeshift  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 2000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== willing targets  
==Target:== multitouch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== touched creatures/objects  
==Effect:== teleport  
This ability teleports the targets to a plane specified by the psion. If the two planes are adjacent they will end up in the same location as if they had used the Otherport creature ability. If they are not adjacent, they will end up at a location determined by the GM. If the psion has memlocked a location on that plane, they can choose to have the group end up there instead.  
  
###### 16 – Planeshift Circle  
==Time to Activate:== 10 minutes  
==EXP Cost:== 5000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== memlock  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== 5 + 1/F’ radius  
==Effect:== interplanar gateway  
This ability creates a circle on the ground in front of the caster and another at the target location. Anyone stepping into one of the circles is instantly teleported into the other. This ability does not require active maintenance.
## Telepathy
###### 1 – Daze  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 round  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== daze creature  
This ability causes the target to be Dazed and do nothing the next time they would get an action.  
  
###### 1 – Detect Lie  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 5 + 5/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== detect lies  
This ability lets the user know whenever the target lies during the duration. This ability cannot determine if the target leaves out information or tells a falsehood that they believe is the truth.  
  
###### 2 – Missive  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 2000’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== send message  
This ability allows the user to send a short message of 20 words or less to the target telepathically. If the user does not share a language with the target it knows something popped into its head but doesn't understand it. The message automatically includes a picture of the user's face so that the target knows who it came from.  
  
###### 2 – Absolute Focus  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== skill increase  
You filter out unnecessary mental noise, allowing you to more efficiently sift through the world around you. You take one die off of all INT skills, including defaults (if applicable).  
  
###### 3 – Day Dream  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== 1 creature  
==Effect:== cause distraction  
This ability causes the target to day dream and pay little attention to their surroundings. This gives them a two-die penalty to all PER attribute checks. This will only work on intelligent creatures that are going about their business normally and that are not concentrating on a task or at a heightened state of alertness.  
  
###### 3 – Ghost  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs INT negates  
==Target:== LOS 30 + 10/F’  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== 1 + 1/F creatures  
==Effect:== remove memory  
This ability removes the instances of caster from the target's past memory, in a time period of up to 30 + 15/F minutes. The spell will fill in the memory of the caster with an ordinary, but randomly generated person. The target will still remember all events that occurred during the time period.  
  
###### 3 – Psionic Detection  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 30 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== LOS 120 + 30/F’  
==Effect:== attribute sight  
You continuously detect the WIL or INT (chosen at the moment of casting) attributes of observable characters within a LOS 120 + 30/F’ radius around yourself. This enhanced sense does not aid in the discovery of invisible characters.  
  
###### 4 – Share Memory  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== give 1 + 1/F memories  
This ability gives 1 + 1/F of the caster’s memories to the target. The target will retain them normally as if they were their own memories but knows they came from an outside source.  
  
###### 4 – Talent of the Telepath  
==Time to Activate:== special*  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== exploit mental weakness  
This ability is used by the psion in conjunction with another ability from the Telepathy discipline. If the target of that ability has previously failed a resistance check for a caster’s Telepathy ability in the past 4 + 2/F rounds, the ability used in conjunction with Talent of the Telepath will be 1 die more difficult to resist. The resistance check cannot be increased past its normal maximum for the spell. For example, if the psion used the Daze ability on a creature 5 rounds ago and the creature failed, the psion can use this ability, finessed once, to increase the resistance check on any Telepathy ability by 1 die (up to its maximum). If the target’s mind had been magically altered in some way, except from this ability’s user, during the time frame this ability would normally function within, this ability will not function. The methods for altering the mind generally involve adding or removing memories, but active magical effects that change the way the mind works can also alter the mind enough. Spells and abilities that grant modifiers to mental attributes are not considered mind altering for this purpose.  
  
###### 4 – Ascendent Mind  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/PU minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== increase mental potential  
The psion may cast this ability to give themselves (1 + 1/4F) ranks of Exceptional Attribute of one of the following attributes: INT, CSE, PER, WIL, PWR.  
  
###### 4 – Shared Missive  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WILnegates  
==Target:== LOS 200 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== 30 + 30/PU minutes  
==Area:== 2 + 1/F creatures  
==Effect:== open communication  
This ability allows the user to open communications, as Missive but with no word count limit, between themselves and 2 + 1/F targets as long as each target remains within range of the user. The caster may create subgroups that include only certain parties but others in the same casting may choose to add or remove themselves from these subgroups. This ability can be finessed an unlimited number of times for targets.  
  
###### 5 – Share Language  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== allow communication  
This ability allows the target to speak a language specified by the caster at the same rank as the caster. This ability affects both the caster and target with a Fate Link.  
  
###### 5 – Knowledge Theft  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single target  
==Effect:== steal memory  
You copy a continuous track of up to 8 hours worth of the target’s memory of a specified time. The target still retains the memory, but you gain a copy of it.  
  
###### 6 – Subconscious Hint  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs INT negates  
==Target:== LOS 50 + 10/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single target  
==Effect:== plant idea  
You implant a thought into the target that the target retains as their own. You take 2 dice off of checks that involve convincing the target to act according to the thought. If the thought is something the target might do under normal circumstances, they will generally act upon it.  
  
###### 6 – Mind Read  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== read thoughts  
This ability allows the caster to hear the target’s thoughts as they occur. If the target fails the resistance check, the caster gains insight into the target’s reasoning (if any), emotional state, and something that looms large in their mind (such as something they worry over, love, or hate). Questions verbally directed at the target naturally shape the course of their thoughts, so this ability is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. In a combat scenario, this grants +2 to all the caster’s Defense Values against attacks made by the target. If the target moves out of the range of the ability, this ability automatically ends.  
  
###### 7 – Share Skill  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== give 1 + 1/2F skills  
This ability lets the target use some of the caster’s skills or specializations for the duration. The target does not actually gain any ranks in the skill or specialization so they cannot buy other abilities that require the skill as a prerequisite. They can only use the number of ranks the caster actually has, not any magical enhancements to the skill or specialization. This ability affects both the caster and target with a Fate Link.  
  
###### 7 – Onivero Bond  
==Time to Activate:== 1 minute  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) days  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== bond minds  
This ability allows the user to create a lasting psionic bond for communication between themselves and one target, they may communicate as Missive (with no word count) at all times, across any distance, and across planes. The target of an Onivero Bond is always considered within valid target range for Telepathy spells if the caster and target share a plane. The caster can maintain CSE/4 Onivero Bonds but the target, if they also can use this ability, consumes a slot up to their own maximum to be a valid target (ie. they count themselves as 1 held Bond to determine their maximum.) The target of an Onivero Bond may end the spell at any time, as though they were the caster.  
  
###### 8 – Pseudo-Mind  
==Time to Activate:== 4 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 30 + 10/(5 PU) minutes  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== false mind  
This ability creates a false mind next to the caster's own mind that is a perfect copy, which detects as a mind, but has absolutely no mental capacity, ability to think, or memories. When the caster is hit by a single target mind-affecting spell or ability, there is a 50% chance that that spell targets the wrong mind and instead hits the false copy, which renders the effect useless. Once the opponent is aware of what is going on, they may make a 5d6 vs INT check to target the correct mind without chance of failure. A single spell failing is not reason to assume this ability is up, it must be a noticeable effect or a spell to detect this.  
  
###### 8 – Fate Link  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 80 + 20/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 10/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== two creatures  
==Effect:== share pain  
This ability links the targets so that any pain experienced by one is felt by the other. Whenever one of them takes damage, the link causes the other to take an equal amount of pain damage. If one fails to resist a spell that incapacitates or affects them through pain, the other automatically suffers the same effects. If one of the creatures dies during the duration of this ability, the other must succeed at a resistance check of four dice against HEA or die as well. The effect triggers once a round per creature on the first announced source of damage. If both targets are affected by the same damage source, like an area of effect damage, the effect does not trigger for that source.  
  
###### 9 – Share Spell  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== give 1 + 1/F spells  
This ability allows the target to cast 1 + 1/F spells or psionic abilities specified by the caster that the caster knows. These spells must be cast with the target's own units. If the target casts a rank 13 or higher spell, they must spend XP as normal. This spell affects both the caster and target with a Fate Link.  
  
###### 9 – Mind Shield  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== willing target  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 2 + 1/(6 PU) hours  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== protect mind  
This ability lies in wait as a response to a mind-altering effect targeting the caster's mind. The caster may choose not to use this when affected with a spell. When activated, this will take 2 dice off the caster’s resistance check against a mind-altering effect. They must choose to use this prior to making the roll and this ability only applies to the first attempt, even if another effect, such as Fate of One, gives the creature a second attempt.  
  
###### 9 – Hallucination  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 120 + 30/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 2/PU minutes  
==Area:== 2 + 1/F targets  
==Effect:== bend reality  
The psion produces an elaborate psionic hallucination in the minds of 2 + 1/F targets, causing the targets to react appropriately. The illusion is perfect; it persists even when targets interact or battle the illusion. Affected targets repeat the save whenever they inflict damage against an ally of theirs, or at the end of every minute. This ability cannot directly cause damage. If the target fails the save, the caster gains knowledge of a few of the target’s deepest fears and gains a dice off of checks that involve playing upon those fears for the next week.  
  
###### 9 – Static Insanity  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 4 + 4/(4 PU) rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== harmful psionic field  
The psion surrounds themself with a 10’ radius field of psionic energy, inflicting 4d6 mental damage to any creature that starts their turn in the field, or the first time they enter the field on their turn.  
  
###### 9 – Grand Missive  
==Time to Activate:== 1 minute  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/PU hours  
==Area:== 12 + 1/F creatures  
==Effect:== bond minds  
This ability allows the user to open communications, as per Shared Missive but between themselves and 12 + 1/F targets as long as each target remains within 250' of the user. The user may additionally require a password or physical token to enter a subgroup but the specifics of password or tokens must be determined and declared when cast. This spell can be finessed an unlimited number of times for targets.  
  
###### 10 – Mental Disintegration  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(2 PU) minutes  
==Area:== 20 + 20/F’ radius  
==Effect:== amplify psionics  
You induce psychic instability in the minds of everyone in a 20 + 20/F’ radius, causing them to incur Susceptibility to Psionics.  
  
###### 10 – Eject  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+1)d6 vs WIL accepts  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== remove outside influences  
This ability automatically negates most abilities and spells that are currently affecting the target's mind and ejects any hostile mind that is currently possessing the body. This will only eject minds that are subsuming the character, such as a Second Lifer spirit or a ghost possessing the person. It will not eject minds that have replaced the original or other forms of body swapping. The target, or the target's original mind if it is being possessed, must succeed at the resistance check or the spell fails. Any spell or ability less than the rank of this ability is automatically negated, for any spell or ability rank 10 or higher roll, treat this spell as a rank 12 Revocation spell.  
  
###### 10 – Send to Sleep  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d6+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 150 + 50/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== fall asleep  
The target of this ability will be put into a magically induced sleep for at least 4 rounds, but may last longer depending on the circumstances, such as if the target was tired, or being lazy.  
  
###### 11 – Psionic Blast  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL halves  
==Target:== LOS 60 + 15/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== special*  
==Effect:== psionic screech  
This ability causes the psion's mind to lash out in a shattering psionic screech. This ability can either target a 30’ + 15/F’ radius area, or concentrate on a single target. Damage dealt in an area deals 8d6 mental damage, where if it is condensed to a single target, it deals 11d6 mental damage instead. Creatures that would be killed by this damage instead fall into a coma that takes a number of rounds to wake from equal to their negative DP.  
  
###### 12 – Mind Swipe  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== (1d6+1)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 20 + 5/F’  
==Duration:== 10 + 5/(5 PU) minutes  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== steal ideas  
The target of this ability has part of their mind stolen by the caster. For the duration, the caster steals one of the following from the target: 2 + 1/2F points of INT, one spell, one skill, or one specialization. The caster must have been aware of the target having it before casting this spell. During the duration, the psion may use the stolen property as if they have it, ignoring most prerequisites, such as having lower ranking spells. The target may not use the stolen property for the duration. This spell cannot be used to take spells above rank 12 and can only be active once on a single target.  
  
###### 12 – Split Personality  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 4 + 1/(4 PU) rounds  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== split mind  
This ability partitions the caster’s mind into two independently functioning parts, in order to multi-task and process information faster. This ability allows the psion to interchangeably use Actions and Fifths for the purpose of activating psionic abilities. This allows the psion to activate 2 action abilities by using their Action and their Fifth. The two parts share the same unit pools and limits.  
  
###### 12 – Synaptic Static  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==Resist Check:== special*  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== 3 + 1/(2 PU) rounds  
==Area:== 60 + 15/F’ radius  
==Effect:== stop psionics  
This ability interferes with all psionics in the area of effect including those used by the psion using this ability. All active psionics can still be maintained but no psion can activate new abilities unless they succeed at a resistance check of 6d6 against WIL each round they try to activate an ability. The caster of this power cannot use any new powers at all regardless of whether they can succeed at the resistance check or not.  
  
###### 13 – Psychic Chirurgery  
==Time to Activate:== 5 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+2)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== repair or alter mind  
The psion cannot use this ability on themself. The primary use of this ability is to repair the target’s damaged mind. Any sort of insanity can be removed and any mind-altering magic can also be removed by rolling (1d6+10)d6 Counterspell. An unlimited number of spells may be affected by one use of this ability, but each must be rolled separately.  
  
###### 14 – Mind Sculpt  
==Time to Activate:== 2 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 3000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+3)d6 vs INT negates  
==Target:== LOS 50 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== sculpt mind  
The target of this ability has their entire memory laid out before the caster. The psion may then choose which memories remain with the target and which memories are removed, and may as well alter any existing memories as they see fit.  
  
###### 14 – Dominate  
==Time to Activate:== 3 rounds  
==EXP Cost:== 1000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d3+3)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== 1 + 1/(5 PU) hours  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== control actions  
This ability allows the caster to mentally control the actions of the target. Any action the target could normally perform can be taken, but it will not take a suicidal action if it succeeds at a resistance check of three dice against WIL. This ability does not give the caster any knowledge of what sort of abilities the target possesses, but of course they can command the target to tell them, if they are capable of communication. This ability allows the caster to command the target from any distance, but does not allow the caster to perceive what is happening around the target so all but the most basic commands are difficult over a distance.  
  
###### 15 – Microcosm  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 3000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== LOS 100 + 25/F’  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== trap mind  
This ability causes the target's mind to be trapped inside itself. Its mind generates a fabricated world to live in until its body dies or this ability is negated. All of its senses are inside its fantasy only and none of its body's senses can penetrate into this world so its body falls limp and will remain that way as long as this ability is in effect. This ability does not require active maintenance.  
  
###### 15 – Arcane Sanctum  
==Time to Activate:== 1 day (8 hours)  
==EXP Cost:== 6000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs PWR*  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== permanent  
==Area:== 200’ radius  
==Effect:== mass read minds  
This ability cannot be made into an item. This ability is cast onto the caster, which gives them some unique mind reading abilities. To someone within the radius, they are able to passively read their mind, which gives them some basic information about any person. It takes 1 round to read a person to learn the following information. The target must make the resist check, and if they fail, they are unaware they are being read. If they succeed, they negate this reading for the round (the caster can reattempt to read the target the next round), and are aware that someone is probing their mind. If failed, the caster will know the target’s preferred name, (possibly not their original or one they are trying to hide), the target’s top 2 highest ranking languages, their intelligence level, their approximate common sense level, their background (but not sub-background), and their approximate rate, rounded to the nearest 10. This spell is not considered valid to be cast with Talent of the Telepath.  
  
###### 16 – Break Free  
==Time to Activate:== 1 round  
==EXP Cost:== 2500 EXP  
==Resist Check:== none  
==Target:== caster  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== self  
==Effect:== break mind magic  
This ability may be activated even when it normally could not, such as during the Dominate ability, a Break Thought spell or other forms of mind controlling magic. When activated, roll 16d6 Counterspell against all mind-affecting spells on the target. It can affect multiple at once, but each is rolled separately.  
  
###### 16 – Enlighten  
==Time to Activate:== 1 minute  
==EXP Cost:== 4000 EXP  
==Resist Check:== (1d4+3)d6 vs WIL negates  
==Target:== touch  
==Duration:== instantaneous  
==Area:== single creature  
==Effect:== grant intelligence  
This ability allows the user to grant intelligence and speech to a creature that normally cannot talk. This is normally used on creatures with low and/or Inferior INT like animals, but can also be used on humanoids with an INT below six. This ability removes all ranks of Inferior INT that the target has and boosts their INT to six. It also modifies their vocal chords so that they can produce speech and grants them six ranks of one of the languages the caster knows at rank six or higher. It does not remove any ranks of Inferior INT that are results of Mutate effects.

###### Ritual of Psychic Awakening
This ritual takes 1 hour to complete and can be performed by any psion with at least 1 rank 14 Telepathy discipline ability. The ritual requires rare herbs and psychoactive ingredients costing 1,200 gold coins.  

This ritual reshapes the target’s mind to awaken psionic abilities, no matter how small their natural potential is. At the time of completion, the target may purchase a rank 1 ability from any psionic discipline with their own experience points. They gain an ability to buy psionics at double base cost following normal rules of [[Psion starting and "clarification"#Psionic Disciplines and Buying Abilities|purchasing psionic abilities]].
